D: VancomycinVancomycins bind to the peptides of the peptidoglycan monomers and block both the formation of gycosidic bonds between the sugars by the transgycosidase enzymes and the formation of the peptide cross-links by the transpeptidase enzymes. This results in a weak cell wall and osmotic lysis of the bacterium.The fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin, lomefloxacin, fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, trovafloxacin, gatifloxacin, etc.) work by inhibiting one or more of a group of enzymes called topoisomerase, enzymes needed for supercoiling, replication and separation of circular bacterial DNA.For example, DNA gyrase is a topoisomerase that catalyzes the negative supercoiling of the circular DNA found in bacteria. Topoisomerase IV, on the other hand, is involved in the relaxation of the supercoiled circular DNA, enabling the separation of the interlinked daughter chromosomes at the end of bacterial DNA replication.In gram-positive bacteria, the main target for fluoroquinolones is DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II), an enzyme responsible for supercoiling of bacterial DNA during DNA replication; in gram-negative bacteria, the primary target is topoisomerase IV, an enzyme responsible for relaxation of supercoiled circular DNA and separation of the inter-linked daughter chromosomes.The tetracyclines (tetracycline, doxycycline, demeclocycline, minocycline, etc.) block bacterial translation by binding reversibly to the 30S subunit and distoing it in such a way that the anticodons of the charged tRNAs cannot align properly with the codons of the mRNA.The aminoglycosides (streptomycin, neomycin, netilmicin, tobramycin, gentamicin, amikacin, etc.) bind irreversibly to the 30S subunit of bacterial ribosomes."

Here is an additional explanation: If a patient provided history that a tooth has been avulsed and it can be determined that the injury is without other oral. neurologic, or higher-priority physical complications. it is best to replace it in the socket immediately and to hold it in place with light finger pressure.\nIf the avulsion occurred in a clean environment, nothing should be done to the tooth before replants it. If the tooth is dirty, an attempt should be made to clean the root surface, but it is very important to preserve any remnants of the periodontal ligament that are still attached to the root. 'therefore the parent would then be instructed to keep the tooth immersed in a suitable storage medium and bring the child and the tooth for immediate care.\nThe patient should receive immediate attention after arriving at the dental office; and if it seems any contamination than it should be rinse thoroughly with saline only do not attempt to scrub tooth by any means to prevent vitality of periodontal fibers and re-implant it in socket.\nIf patient or parent cannot or will not replant it than procedure to maintain vitality of tooth\nAllowing the avulsed tooth to dehydrate before replantation is damaging to a favourable prognosis.\nHanks buffered saline, isotonic saline, and pasteurized bovine milk may be the most favourable known storage media. If none of these solutions is readily available, human saliva is acceptable short-term substitute storage liquid. Presumably, the patient's saliva (and perhaps blood) would be readily available.\nAlthough tap water has been a commonly recommended storage solution (and its use would be preferable to allowing dehydration of the tooth), saliva is a better storage medium. Neither water nor saliva is as good as milk or saline, if the tooth must be stored for a long period (more than 30 minutes before replantation). Because water is hypotonic, its use leads to rapid cell lysis and increased inflammation on replantation."

Complications of Bronchogenic cyst :-\nInfection of the cyst leading to lung abscess (illediastinal bronchogenic cysts do not communicate with the bronchi but those situated within the lung may communicate with the airways leading to abscess formation).\nCompression can produce either hyperinflation of the lung or atelactasis due to obstruction.\nTension pneumothorax (d/t rupture of cyst that communicates with bronchus)."

The remaining 75% of cases arise as de novo events and convey a low recurrence risk of approximately 1%\nIf, however, a parent is shown to be a carrier then there will be a significant risk that a future child will be affected, usually of the order of 2-5% for a carrier male and 10-15% for a carrier female.\nIn the very rare event that a parent carries a balanced 21q21e Robertsonian translocation, the risk of Down's\u00a0\u00a0 drome in liveborn offs rin\u2022 will be 100%.\n\n\u200bRisk of abnormal offspring for a carrier of a balanced translocation"

SNHLsymptoms of SSDC include* Tullio phenomenon - identifiable symptoms leading to a positive SCD diagnosis is sound-induced loss of balance. Patients showing this symptom may experience a loss of equilibrium, a feeling of motion sickness or even actual nausea, triggered by normal everyday sounds.* Vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP): In SSCD, loud tones evoke a sho-latency relaxation potential in the ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid muscle. Patients with SSCD typically have a lower-than-normal threshold for the VEMP response, and the amplitude of the VEMP waveform in an SSCD ear is greater for comparable stimulus intensities than in an ear without dehiscence. The VEMP test plays an impoant role in the evaluation of patients with suspected SSCD* Low-frequency conductive hearing loss is present in many patients with SCDS and is explained by the dehiscence acting as a \"third window phenomenon\""

These are extremely resistant to inactivation by heat, disinfectants, and radiation.\nThe prions are causative agents of slow viral infections, such as subacute spongiform encephalopathy. After long incubation period of years, they produce a progressive disease that causes damage to the central nervous system, leading to subacute spongiform encephalopathy.\u00a0\nThey are readily inactivated by autoclave at 121oC and resistant to antiseptics and disinfectants.\n\nParija SC.

It is therefore, believed to be free of cardiovascular risk. No Q-T prolongation has been noted during clinical trial.* Side effects are headache, dizziness, fatigue, abdominal pain and diarrhoea; but generally subside during use."

The postganglionic fibers innervate the lacrimal gland and are responsible for the formation of tears.Greater petrosal nerve damage will deprive the lacrimal gland of its secretomotor fibers and this would lead to the absence of tears.Greater petrosal nerve damage can happen in case of intrapetrosal mass lesions, a trauma in case of temporal bone injuries, etc."

Slow waves 2. Spikes Slow waves: - Most gastro intestinal contractions occur rhythmically & this rhythm is determined mainly by frequency of 'slow waves' - These are not action potentials, instead they are slow undulating changes in resting membrane potential - These waves are caused by complex interactions among smooth muscle cells & interstitial cells of cajal. - Slow waves usually do not themselves cause muscle contraction (except in stomach) instead they mainly excite appearance of intermittent spike potential & spike potentials in turn actually excite muscle contraction. Parasympathetic neurons - depolarize smooth muscle cell & makes muscle fibers more excitable. Smooth muscle contraction occurs in response to entry of calcium ions into muscle fiber. Enteric nervous system composed of 2 plexuses 1. Myenteric plexus / Auerbach's plexus - outer 2. Submucosal Meissner's plexus - inner Myenteric plexus control G.I movements Submucosal plexus control G.I secretions & local blood flow."

Here is an additional explanation: In BPH, urinary obstruction is present because of increased size of prostate(static component). This is increased by spasm of urethra(dynamic component).To dilate urethra; alpha 1A receptor blockers like tamsulosin and silodosin are used. These provide the immediate symptomatic relief by treating the dynamic component.To decrease the size of prostate, 5 alpha reductase inhibitors are used which inhibit the conversion of testosterone to DHT(dihydrotestosterone). Drugs are dutasteride and finasteride. These drugs are given for long duration."

On examination, blood pressure was 88/60 mmHg. RBC esterase level is 50. What should be the treatment of this person? Atropine. Here is an additional explanation: Low esterase levels are suggestive of overdose of some drug which acts by inhibiting acetyl choline esterase like organophosphate poisoning. Inhibition of choline esterase results In increased amount of Ach at synapse, so poisoning or overdose results in cholinergic symptoms like salivation, lacrimation, urination, emesis, increased bronchial secretions, reduction in blood pressure.So treatment Of choice is Atropine. Atropine -It is highly effective in counter-acting the muscarinic symptoms, but higher doses are required to antagonize the central effects. It does not reverse peripheral muscular paralysis which is a nicotinic action. All cases of anti-ChE (carbamate or organophosphate) poisoning must be promptly given atropine2 mg i.v. repeated every 10 min till dryness of mouth or other signs of atropinization appear (upto 200 mg has been administered in a day). Continued treatment with maintenance doses may be required for 1-2 weeks. Neostigmine and physostigmine worsens the signs and symptoms as these also act by inhibiting choline esterase. Physostigmine and flumazenil are respectively used for Atropine and benzodiazepines poisoning."

Here is an additional explanation: - Metronidazole is drug of choice for bacterial vaginosis ( with or without pregnancy )- Alternative to metronidazole is clindamycin.- Rovamycin i.e. spiramycin (which is a macrolide) is drug of choice for toxoplasmosis in pregnancy. Metronidazole -* It is the prototype nitroimidazole having broad-spectrum cidal activity against anaerobic protozoa, including Giardia lamblia , trichomonas and amoeba. * Many anaerobic and microaerophilic bacteria, such as Bact. fragilis, Fusobacterium, Clostridium perfringens, Cl. difficile, Helicobacter pylori, Campylobacter, peptococci, spirochetes and anaerobic Streptococci are sensitive. * Metronidazole does not affect aerobic bacteria. Mechanism of action- After entering the cell by diffusion, its nitro group is reduced by ceain redox proteins operative only in anaerobic microbes to a highly reactive nitro radical which exes cytotoxicity. The nitro radical of metronidazole acts as an electron sink which competes with the biological electron acceptors of the anaerobic organism for the electrons generated by the pyruvate : ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) enzyme pathway of pyruvate oxidation. The energy metabolism of anaerobes that have no mitochondria is thus, disrupted. Aerobic environment attenuates cytotoxicity of metronidazole by inhibiting its reductive activation. Moreover, O2 competes with the nitro radical of metronidazole for the free electrons generated during energy metabolism of anaerobes. Metronidazole, in addition, has been found to inhibit cell mediated immunity, to induce mutagenesis and to cause radiosensitization. Uses of metronidazole- o Amoebiasiso Giardiasiso Trichomonas vaginitiso Bacterial vaginosiso Anaerobic bacterial infection o Pseudomembranous enterocolitiso Acute necrotising ulcerative gingivitiso Helicobacter pylori gastritis o Guinea worm infestation"

There is usually marked congestion, cyanosis, and petechiae in the face and neck.This occurs when the individual acquires a ceain body position in which breathing is impaired, often because of neck twisting with kinking or compression of trachea and/or elevation of the tongue into the posterior hypopharynx. Normal venous return to the hea may be impaired.The body is typically inveed (upside-down) & weight of abdominal contents press against the diaphragm pushing it upwards, thus compressing the thoracic organs, which combined with decreased respiratory movements, leads to cardiorespiratory failure & death.It is always accidental"

The fetal prognosis for women with chronic renal disease is favorable as long as they do not develop superimposed preeclampsia.\nSecond to hypertension, the most valuable prognostic index for patients with chronic renal disease during pregnancy is the degree of renal function impairment:\n\n\u2013 In patients with normal or only midly impaired renal function, pregnancy does not accelerate renal damage\n\u2013 In patients with moderate renal insufficiency (serum creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL or greater before pregnancy or creatinine clearance <30 ml/min. there is a decline in renal function during pregnancy).\n\nAnother important prognostic sign is the presence or absence of proteinuria. As a general rule, if the patient has 2+ or more protein in qualitative tests or 3 g or more in 24 hours urine collections at the beginning of pregnancy, the tendency will be toward increased protein losses and development of nephritic syndrome during pregnancy.\nThe histologic characteristics of the renal lesion also have prognostic value."

        "generated_explanation": "The principal reason for placing an aluminium filter in\nthe primary beam of radiation is to: Reduce radiation to the skin of the patient. Here is an additional explanation: Although an x-ray beam consists of a continuous spectrum of x-ray photon energies, only photons with sufficient energy to penetrate through anatomic structures and reach the image receptor (digital or film) are useful for diagnostic radiology. Low-energy photons\u00a0that cannot reach the receptor contribute to patient risk but do no offer any benefit. Consequently, it is desirable to remove these low-energy photons from the beam. This removal can be accomplished in part by placing a metallic disk (filter) in the beam path.\u00a0\nA filter preferentially removes low-energy photons from the beam, while allowing high energy photons that are able to contribute to making an image to pass through.\u00a0\nRef: Oral Radiology, Principles and Interpretation / Stuart C.

Ricketts suggested using an esthetic (E) plane to evaluate the relationship between the nose, lips and chin. Ricketts\u2019 E line is drawn from the tip of the nose to the soft tissue chin. A quick method to look at one profile is to imagine a line tangent from the lower chin to the nose tip. Cephalometrically, Ricketts\u2019 E line is drawn from the tip of the nose to the soft tissue chin. Normal values suggest that the upper lip is 4 mm behind the E line, while the lower lip lies 2 mm behind this reference line. It is important to mention that, this reference line is influenced a great deal by the growth of the nose and also varies with age and sex. Ricketts recommended that lip position should be analyzed using the nose\u2013chin line as a reference point. These values are for Caucasians and clearly cannot be applied to all races.\nRef: Orthodontics: Diagnosis and Management of Malocclusion and Dentofacial Deformities, 3e, Om P. Kharbanda pdf no 1097"

What is the likely diagnosis? Shin splint. Here is an additional explanation: Shin splints (stress fracture) are seen in runners, army recruits or any vigorous physical activity. STRESS/FATIGUE FRACTUREStress fracture is due to imbalance between load and resistance of bone. It is of 2 types:1. Fatigue Fracture: caused by application of abnormal stress on normal bone.2. Insufficiency Fracture: caused by normal activity on weak bone. Sites of Stress FracturesLower Extremity* March fracture is a stress fatigue fracture of second metatarsal neck > 3rd metatarsal neck.* The most common site is metatarsal neck followed by tibia (proximal third in children, middle third in athlete and lower third in elderly).* Tibia stress fracture = Shin splints* Femoral neck (inferomedial compression side in young and superior tension side in older patients).* Rarely fibula lower end (runners fracture). Upper Extremity* Olecranon is most common site of upper limb stress fractures. Pelvis and SpinePars inter aicularis of 5th lumbar veebral (causing spondylolysis) is commonest in spine. Clinical Presentation* Load related pain often bilateral* The hallmark physical finding is tenderness with palpation and stress. InvestigationMRI provide excellent sensitivity and superior specificity compared to bone scan in differentiating from infections or tumors.Bone scan is preferable for bilateral cases due to feasibility, also bilateral cases go in our of stress fracture as compared to Infection or tumor and also can scan the whole body.* Treatment is symptomatic with cast and cessation of activity."

Here is an additional explanation: Midline intracranial mass with bruit on ausculation and features of hydrocephalus and congestive heart failure \u00adAll point towards Vein of Galen Malformation.\n\nVein of Galen Malformations(VGM) \n\nThe vein of Galen is a large deep vein at the base of the brain. It is located under the cerebral hemispheres and drains the anterior and central regions of the brain into the sinuses of the posterior cerebral fossa .\nVGM results from an aneurysmal malformation with an arteriovenous shunting of blood.VGM usually causes high-output heart failure in the newborn resulting from the decreased resistance and high blood flow in the lesion.\nAssociated findings include cerebral ischemic changes such as strokes or steal phenomena that result in progressive hemiparesis.\nThe malformation may result in mass effects, causing progressive neurological impairment. Alternatively, the malformation may cause obstruction of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow and result in hydrocephalus.\nLoud intracranial bruit may be heard because of the blood turbulence in VGM.\nThe most effective treatment for the malformation has been embolization rather than surgery \nThe vein of Galen abnormality is the most frequent arteriovenous malformation in neonates."

Which one of the following drugs you would like to avoid \u2013 Isoprenaline. Here is an additional explanation: In Tetralogy of Fallot there is right outflow obstruction due to pulmonary stenosis with supravalvular pulmonary artery obstruction.\n\n\nIn case of severe obstruction, the right ventricular pressure becomes greater than the left ventricular presence and the deoxygenated blood starts moving to the left ventricle resulting in severe cyanosis and erythrocytosis.\nIn this situation the aim is to increase blood flow towards the right heart. The methods adopted are compression of Aorta (knee chest position) and use of vasopressor drugs like methoxamine (Phenylepinephrine is also a vasopressor).\nAny condition or drug which causes peripheral pooling of blood should be avoided because this will reduce return of blood to heart.\nTherefore isoprenaline which has marked 13, agonistic action should be avoided as it will cause vasodilatation which leads to peripheral pooling of blood. This will be harmful in a case of Tetralogy of Fallot."

Urine specimen through catheterization or indwelling catheter \u2014\n\nUrine specimen through a catheter is less likely to be contaminated than the voided specimens as described above. It is also less invasive than suprapubic aspiration, but it is not as sensitive as suprapubic aspiration.\n\n\nA catherized specimen is reliable if the first portion of the urine that may contain urethral organisms is discarded and specimen is taken from later flow through the catheter, but it has the disadvantage of being traumatic and of potentially introducing urethral organisms into sterile bladder\n\n\nSuprapubic aspiration -\nSuprapubic aspiration is best method to collect urine specimen for culture.\nIt is the most reliable method\nIt can be performed safely in children and in premature infants by 21 or 22 gauge needle.\nThis procedure avoids any sort of contamination, however it is invasive.

        "generated_explanation": "A boy is suffering from acute pyelonephritis. The most specific investigation is Histopathological examination. Here is an additional explanation: The answer is A Acute pyelonephritis is a bacterial infection causing inflammation of the kidneys and is one of the most common diseases of the kidney.Pyelonephritis occurs as a complication of an ascending urinary tract infection (UTI) which spreads from the bladder to the kidneys and their collecting systems.Symptoms usually include fever, flank pain, nausea, vomiting, burning on urination, increased frequency, and urgency. The 2 most common symptoms are usually fever and flank pain. E. coli is the most common bacteria causing acute pyelonephritis due to its unique ability to adhere to and colonize the urinary tract and kidneys.Histopathology will usually reveal necrosis or putrid abscess formation within the renal parenchyma. The renal tissues are infiltrated with neutrophils, macrophages and plasma cells. However, architecture is not completely disorganized.The presence of white blood cells within or upon casts strongly suggests pyelonephritis, direct infection of the kidney. They may also be seen in inflammatory states, such as acute allergic interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, or post-streptococcal acute glomerulonephritis."

Genotyping and other tests such as measurement of nasal membrane potential difference, pancreatic function should be done if there is high clinical suspicion of cystic fibrosis.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0 Nasal potential difference\n\nMeasurement of nasal transepithelial potential difference in vivo can be useful adjunct in the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.\nIndividuals with cystic fibrosis demonstrate a significantly more negative baseline nasal potential difference, with the topical application of amiloride there is loss of this potential difference.\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0 Genetic analysis\n\nCystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder.\nIt is caused due to defect in CFTR (Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) protein.\nCystic fibrosis is associated with large number of mutations.\nMore than 1500 CFTR polymorphisms are associated with cystic fibrosis syndrome.\nThe most prevalent mutation of CFTR is the deletion of single phenylalanine residue at amino acid A508.\nThis mutation is responsible for high incidence of cystic fibrosis in northern European populations.\nApproximately 50% of individuals with CF who are of northern European ancestry are homozygous for A508 and >70% carry at least one A508 gene. The remainder of patients has an extensive array of mutation, none of which has prevalance of more than several percent.\nTesting for cystic fibrosis mutation was not possible because of the large no. of mutations associated with the disease.\nNow days commercial laboratories test for 30-80 of the most common CFTR mutations.\nThis testing identifies >90% individuals who carry 2CF mutations.\nNo where it is mentioned in the texts that testing only for A508 is enough for diagnosis. Detection of atleast 2 CF mutations are necessary for making the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis."

Hyper IgM syndrome - In this disorder the affected patients make IgM antibodies but are deficient in their ability to produce IgG, IgA and IgE antibodies. There is problem in Ig class switching. Approximately 70%of individuals with hyper lgM syndrome have the X linked form of the disease , caused by mutations in the gene coding CD40L located on Xq26. In remaining patients,the disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Most of these patients have loss of function mutation involving either CD40 or enzyme called AID. So, B-cells can be detected by flowcytometryhaving low expression of CD40. Bruton's disease -In this disease, there is defect in B-cell tyrosine kinase enzyme. This leads to hypogammaglobulinemia. Bare lymphocyte syndrome- In this disorder, There is defect in MHC-2 molecule which is required for CD4 T-cell formation. SCID - This is both X-linked and autosomal recessive disorder."

Here is an additional explanation: PCR is an in vitro DNA amplification procedure in which millions of copies of a paicular sequence of DNA can be produced within a few hours.The reaction cycle has the following steps:Step 1: Separation (Denaturation): DNA strands are separated (melted) by heating at 95degC for 15 seconds to 2 minutes.Step 2: Priming (Annealing): The primers are annealed by cooling to 50degC for 0.5 to 2 minutes. The primers hybridize with their complementary single-stranded DNA produced in the first step.Step 3: Polymerization: New DNA strands are synthesized by Taq polymerase. This enzyme is derived from bacteria Thermus aquaticus that are found in hot springs.The steps of 1,2 and 3 are repeated. In each cycle, the DNA strands are doubled. Thus, 20 cycles provide for 1 million times amplifications. These cycles are generally repeated by automated instrument, called Tempcycler.5. After the amplification procedure, DNA hybridization technique or Southern blot analysis with a suitable probe shows the presence of the DNA in the sample tissue.Dideoxyribonucleotides are not used in the polymerase chain reaction."

Here is an additional explanation: Patient is developing tingling sensation (peripheral neuropathy) which is a side effect of Isoniazid (INH) a first line antitubercular drug. INH is extensively metabolized in liver; most impoant pathway being N-acetylation by NAT2. The acetylated metabolite is excreted in urine. The rate of INH acetylation shows genetic variation. There are either: Fast acetylators: (30-40% of Indians) t1/2 of INH 1 hr. Slow acetylators: (60-70% of Indians) t1/2 of INH 3 hr. Slow acetylators will not be able to metabolize the drug quickly and there will be accumulation of isoniazid. Isoniazid inhibits pyridoxal phosphokinase enzyme and hence causes peripheral neuritis, paraesthesias, numbness etc. Pyridoxine given prophylactically (10mg/day) prevents this neurotoxicity. On the other hand, fast acetylators are more prone to develop."

Baby will develop neoatal varicella syndrome. Here is an additional explanation: Varicella infection in pregnancy:\n\nIf varicella infection occurs in a pregnant female during first half of pregnancy (M/C time of transmission-13 to 20 weeks) it results in congenital varicella syndrome in the fetus.\nCongenital varicella syndrome in characterized by chorioretinitis, microophthalmia, cerebral cortical atrophy, IUGR, hydronephrosis and skin or bone defects.\nCongenital varicella syndrome is an indication for doing MTP.\nCongenital defects rarely occurs if varicella infection occurs after 20 weeks.\nThe terminology varicella embryopathy is not used these days.\nNeonatal varicella iin characterized by pneumonitis, hepatitis and DIC.\nThe severity of neonatal infection is inversely related to the concentration of maternal antibodies present in the newborn circulation. Mother starts producing and transferring antibodies approximately 5 days after the onset of her disease.Thus, babies born 5 days or more from the beginning of maternal disease will be protected.\n\nFernando Arias 3/e, p 156\n\nPerinatal varicella exposure just before or during delivery poses a serious threat to newborns and so Varicella Ig should be given to all neonates of born to mothers who have clinical evidence of varicella 5 days before and upto 2 days after delivery.\nThe use of VZIG decreases the chances of neonatal varicella and also modify the clinical course but it does not always prevent severe or fatal varicella. Expectant treatment with close observation, followed by prompt initiation of antiviral therapy on suspicion of neonatal varicella is recommended.\nAntiviral treatment (acyclovir) is given to neonates only if they develop neonatal varicella syndrome.\nVaccine is not secreted in breast milk, so postpartum vaccination should not be delayed because of breast feeding."

Here is an additional explanation: Before answering these questions lets first discuss hepatitis in brief.\nMaternal infection: The acute infection is manifested by flu like illness as malaise, anorexia, nausea and vomiting. In majority, it remains asymptomatic. Jaundice is rare and fever is uncommon.\nClinical course (HBV): Nearly 90\u201395% of patients clear the infection and have full recovery. 1% develop fulminant hepatitis resulting massive hepatic necrosis. 10-15% become chronic and 10% of these chronic cases suffer from chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.\nDiagnosis is confirmed by serological detection of HBsAg, HBeAg (denote high infectivity) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) and HBV DNA titer (107\u20131011).\nScreening: All pregnant women should be screened for HBV infection at first antenatal visit and it should be repeated during the third trimester for \u2018high risk\u2019 groups (intravenous drug abusers, sexual promiscuity, hemophilics, patients on hemodialysis or having multiple sex partners).\nHepatitis C (HCV):\nIt is recognized as the major cause of non-A, non-B hepatitis worldwide and is the leading cause of transfusion associated hepatitis. Transmission is mainly blood borne and to a lesser extent by faecal-oral route. It is responsible for chronic active hepatitis and hepatic failure.\nPerinatal transmission (10\u201340%) is high when coinfected with HIV and HBV.\nDetection is by antibody to HCV by EIA, which develops usually late in the infection.\nConfirmation is done by recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA-3).\nChronic carrier state is present. Breastfeeding is not contraindicated.\nHepatitis D (HDV):\nIt is seen in patients infected with HBV either as a co-infection or super infection. Perinatal transmission is known.\nHepatitis E (HEV): Hepatitis E is the most important cause of non-A, non-B hepatitis in developing countries like India. Chronic carrier state is present. Perinatal transmission is uncommon.\nMaternal mortality is very high (15\u201320%)."

Which of the following is not done in Mmn: Supine position. Here is an additional explanation: \u201cDeceleration is defined as a decrease in fetal heart rate below the base line of 15 beats per minute or more.\u201d\nVariable deceleration is seen in case of cord-compression/prolapse. In case of cord-compression/prolapse patient should not be allowed to rest in supine position as it will lead to more pressure on the cord. In cord prolapse the patient is allowed to rest in exaggerated elevated Sims position with a pillow under the hip.\nManagement of Non-reassuring fetal status (Fetal Distress)\n\nLateral positioning avoids compression of vena cava and aorta by the gravid uterus. This increases cardiac output and uteroplacental perfusion.\nOxygen is administered to the mother with mask to improve fetal SaO2.\nCorrection of dehydration by IV fluids (crystalloids) improves intravascular volume and uterine perfusion.\nCorrection of maternal hypotension (following epidural analgesia) with immediate infusion of 1 litre of Crystalloid (Ringer\u2019s solution).\nStoppage of oxytocin to improve fetal oxygenation. Fetal hypoxia may be due to strong and sustained uterine contractions. With reassuring FHR and in absence of fetal acidemia, oxytocin may be restarted.\nTocolytic (Injection terbutaline 0.25 mg S.C.) is given when uterus is hypertonic and there is nonreassuring FHR.\nAmnioinfusion is the process to increase the intrauterine fluid volume with warm normal saline (500 ml). Indications are:\n\n\u2013 Oligohydramnios and cord compression\n\u2013 To dilute or to wash out meconium\n\u2013 To improve variable or prolonged decelerations.\nAdvantages : Reduces cord compression, meconium aspiration, and improves Apgar score."

Here is an additional explanation: Evidence of antecedent group 'A' streptococcal infection \n\nPositive throat cultures or rapid streptococcal antigen tests for group A streptococcoci are less reliable for antecedent infection capable of producing rheumatic fever because they do not distinguish between recent infection and chronic pharyngeal carriage (as many people are carrier of this bacteria).\nAntibody tests are the most reliable laboratory evidence of antecedent streptococcal infection capable of producing\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 g acute rheumatic fever. The onset of clinical manifestations of acute rheumatic fever coincides with the peak of the streptococcal antibody response.\nThe antibodies used commonly for serological tests are antistreptolysin 0 (ASO), antideoxyribonuclease (Anti-DNAse) and antihyaluronidase.\nASO titre is well standardized and therefore is most widely used test. It has following features.\n\n\nElevated in 80% of patients with acute rheumatic fever (So, 20% patients do not show elevated titre) Sensitivity is 80%.\nIt is elevated in 20% of normal individuals perticularly in healthy school children of elementary school age (20% false positive).\nASO titers of at least 333 Todd units in children and 250 Todd units in adults are considered elevated.\nIt is included in minor criteria of jones criteria (not in major criteria).\n\n\nAnti DNAse B titers of 240 Todd units or greater in children and 1200 Todd units or greater in adults are considered elevated.\nIf three antibody tests (ASO, anti-DNAse and anti-hyaluronidase) are used simultaneously, a titer for at least one antibody test is elevated in 95% of cases \u2014> Sensitivity of combined three antibody tests is 95%.\nThe streptozyme test is a simple slide agglutination test for extra-cellular streptococcal antigen absorbed to red blood cells (passive hemagglutination) test. It is almost 100% sensitive but specificity is very low and it is less standardized and less reproducible than the other antibody tests. Therefore, it should not be used as a diagnostic test for evidence of antecedent group A streptococcal infection.\n\nAbout option 'b'\n\nASO titre may not be elevated in PSGN if PSGN develops secondary to skin infection."
