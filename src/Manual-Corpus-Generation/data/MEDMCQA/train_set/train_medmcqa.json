During feilization, the sperm and egg cell nuclei fuse to form an embryo.The egg cell is very large compared to the sperm, so although the cells nuclei fuse, the rest of the cell mass in the embryo comes from the egg only.Nuclear DNA is therefore co-inherited but the mitochondrial DNA, which is located outside of the nucleus, is always maternally inherited because all mitochondria in a foetus and later adult are derived from the mitochondria in the mother 's egg.So, in diseases showing mitochondria! inheritance all children from affected mother will inherit the disease but it will not be transmitted from an affected father to his children."

Here is an additional explanation: The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia ultimately rests on laboratory studies. Both the hemoglobin and hematocrit are depressed, usually to a moderate degree, in association with hypochromia, microcytosis, and modest poikilocytosis. The serum iron and ferritin are low The total plasma iron-binding capacity (reflecting elevated transferrin levels) is high. Low serum iron with increased iron binding capacity results in a reduction of transferrin saturation to below 15%. Reduced iron stores inhibit hepcidin synthesis, and its serum levels fall. In uncomplicated iron deficiency, oral iron supplementation produces an increase in reticulocytes in about 5 to 7 days that is followed by a steady increase in blood counts and the normalization of red cell indices Earliest parameter to be affected in the Iron deficiency anemia patient - Serum ferritin. Gold standard for making the diagnosis of Iron deficiency anemia - Bone marrow examination (storage iron in the form of ferritin or protein hemosiderin can be detected with the help of stain Prussian blue.)"

Increased conversion of fatty acid to acetyl CoA. Here is an additional explanation: The diabetic situation is same as fasting i.e. breakdown or catabolism will be increased & anabolism or synthesis is decreased. So in Diabetes, fats (TG) are broken down in adipose tissue to give fatty acids. These fatty acids go in blood & then to the liver. In liver, these fatty acids are broken down by beta-oxidation of fatty acids to give Acetyl CoA. This excess acetyl CoA obtained from fatty acids breakdown is used for the formation of fats e.g. fatty acids, endogenous TGs, VLDL & cholesterol. This is the only anabolic thing occurring in the liver of diabetic patients. Options A & B - wrong as the body is mainly in catabolism, not anabolism.

Dense old scars may undergo hyaline degeneration and subsequent calcification.2. Atheromas in the aoa and coronaries frequently undergo calcification.3. Mo?nckeberg's sclerosis shows calcification in the tunica media of muscular aeries in elderly people.4. The stroma of tumors such as uterine fibroids, breast cancer, thyroid adenoma, goiter, etc shows calcification.5. Some tumors show characteristic spherules of calcification called psammoma bodies or calcospherites such as in meningioma, papillary serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary and papillary carcinoma of the thyroid.6. Cysts that have been present for a long time may show calcification of their walls e.g. epidermal and pilar cysts.7. Calcinosis cutis is a condition of unknown cause in which there are irregular nodular deposits of calcium salts in the skin and subcutaneous tissue.8. Senile degenerative changes may be accompanied by dystrophic calcification such as in coastal cailages, tracheal or bronchial cailages, and pineal glands in the brain, etc."

Here is an additional explanation: Timing of SABG surgery:\nSecondary alveolar bone grafting (SABG) is done at an age when the growth inhibition effects of the surgery on maxilla are minimised, and it can help the maxillary canine or lateral incisor to erupt normally through the cancellous bone. After the age of 9 years, maxillary growth is minimal. Secondary bone grafting is done during the mixed dentition stage after the eruption of permanent incisors, but before the eruption of permanent canines. The timing of bone graft is based on the root formation and eruption pattern of the maxillary lateral incisor and maxillary canine. In case, insufficient bone is available in the cleft area for the lateral incisors to erupt, bone graft can be done around 7 years of age.\nNote:\u00a0In this patient, since the transverse width is normal, there is no need for expansion.\nOrthodontics: Diagnosis and Management of Malocclusion and Dentofacial Deformities 3rd ed Om P.

Here is an additional explanation: Answer- B- Cover Uncover TestSince the diagnosis is latent strabismus the correct answer is B > Cover-uncover test. It tells about the presence and type of heterophoria. To perform it, one eye is covered with an occluder and the other is made to fix an object. In the presence of heterophoria, the eye under cover will dete. After a few seconds the cover is quickly removed and the movement of the eye (which was under cover) is observed. Direction of movement of the eyeball tells the type of heterophoria >The forced duction test is performed in order to determine whether the absence of movement of the eye is due to a neurological disorder or a mechanical restriction. The anesthetized conjunctiva is grasped with forceps and an attempt is made to move the eyeball in the direction where the movement is restricted. > FUNDUS EXAMINATION This is essential to diagnose the diseases of the vitreous, optic nerve head, retina and choroid."

In male and females, the infantile pituitary gland & ovaries are capable of full function if they are appropriately stimulated. However, for reasons not understood, the hypothalamus does not secrete significant quantities of GnRH during childhood. At pubey, the hypothalamus stas secreting pulsatile GnRH, which initiates the other cascading events leading to maturity of the sexual organs and pubey."

In patients with cushing syndrome this circadium rhythm is lost, and cortisol levels at midnight and 8 AM are usually comparable. Obtaining diurnal blood samples present logistical difficulties as part of an outpatient evaluation, but cortisol can be measured in saliva samples, which can be obtained at home at the appropriate times of day. Night time salivary cortisol levels are elevated and may be a screening test in obese children."

Inflammation, mucoceles of sinuses, sinunasal polyposis, fungal infection of sinuses & osteomyelitis, can all erode the bone and dura. Neoplasms, idiopathic- where cause is unknown and patient has spontaneous leak. SITE OF Leakage- CSF from anterior cranial fossa reaches the nose (1) cribriform plate, (2) roof of ethmoid air cells or (3) frontal sinus. CSF from middle cranial fossa follows injuries to sphenoid sinus, cribriform plate. In fracture of temporal bone, CSF reaches the middle ear and then escapes through the Eustachian tube into the nose (CSF OTORHINORRHOEA) DIAGNOSIS- there is history of clear watery discharge from the nose on bending the head or straining. CSF rhinorrhea should be differentiated from nasal discharge as the former is sudden, gushes in drops when bending and cannot be sniffed back. CSF rhinorrhea after head trauma is mixed with blood and shows \"target sign\" when collected on filter paper.it shows central red spot and peripheral lighter halo sign.

FerropoinIron leaves the mucosal cell a transpo protein ferropoin, but only if there is free transferrin in plasma to bind to. Once transferrin is saturated with iron, any that has accumulated in the mucosal cells is lost when the cells are shed. Expression of the ferropoin gene is downregulated by hepcidin, a peptide secreted by the liver when body iron reserves are adequate. In response to hypoxia, anemia, or hemorrhage, the synthesis of hepcidin is reduced, leading to increased synthesis of ferropoin and increased iron absorption. As a result of this mucosal barrier, only ~10% of dietary iron is absorbed, and only 1 to 5% from many plant foods."

Here is an additional explanation: In insulin structure.:- A chain has total 21 Amino Acid. 6th, 7th, 11th, and 20th Amino Acid Are Cysteine and these residuals are responsible for the formation of disulphide bond. If we break disulphide bond in a protein this will lead to denaturation of the protein. B Chain has total 30 amino acid.7th and 19th are cysteine So they also cannot be changed, or if changed will lead to denaturation of the protein Thus options C and D can be ruled out. Interchange of A1 & A4, i.e. glycine and glutamate, which can also be ruled out because glycine is an amino acid which is conserved during evolution in most of the proteins. Interchange of B29 and B30: - The insulin which is used in the treatment - Insulin lispro actually has a change in the carboxy terminal of B chain. So, changes can be made here for changing little bit of propeies and not going to damage the structure much. EXTRA EDGE: Gene coding for insulinis localized on11p15 site of chromosome."

Alopecia areata(Ref Rooks 8/e p66.13, Fitzpatrick 6/e p732)Findings are highly suggestive of alopecia areata.The scalp appears normal in alopecia areata.In affected areas, anagen is abruptly terminated prematurely and affected hairs move prematurely into telogen, with resultant often precipitous hair shedding.The near pathognomonic 'exclamation point' hairs may be present, paicularly at the periphery of areas of hair loss.These sho broken hairs, whose distal ends are broader than the proximal ends, illustrate their inherent sequence of events: follicular damage in anagen and then a rapid transformation to telogen. White or graying hairs are, frequently spared and probably account, in cases offulminant alopecia areata, far the mysterious phenomenon of 'going gray overnight.'"

Septicemic shockSepticemia is mainly due to endotoxin like activity as seen in Gram-negative bacilli and not due to exotoxin. Clinically, Staphylococcus aureus sepsis presents like that documented for sepsis due to other bacteria. Septicemic shock is not directly caused due to toxins and other virulence factors play a role like protein A, fibrinolysin and coagulase, which are anti-phagocytic, suppress host immunity and helps in the spread of infection. Septicemia is mainly due to endotoxin tike activity as seen in Gram-negative bacilli and not due to exotoxin. S.aureus produces free types of toxin: cytotoxins, pyrogenic toxin superantigens, and exfoliative toxins. Both epidemiologic data and studies in animals suggest that antitoxin antibodies are protective against illness in TSS' staphylococcal food poisoning, and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS).

        "generated_explanation": "The best way to remove a hydrocolloid impression from the patient's mouth is: Sudden jerking of the impression to prevent tearing. Here is an additional explanation: Since alginate is a viscoelastic material, its tear strength is increased when the impression is removed along a vertical\u00a0path with a snap. The speed of removal must be a compromise between\u00a0a\u00a0 rapid\u00a0movement\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0slower\u00a0rate\u00a0that\u00a0is\u00a0more comfortable for the patient. Usually an\u00a0alginate impression does not adhere to the oral tissues as well as some of the elastomers do, so it is easier to remove the alginate impression rapidly. However, it is always best to avoid torquing or twisting the impression in an effort to remove it quickly. Specifically, the handle should be used minimally during breaking of the air seal (\u201csuction\u201d) or removal of the tray from the teeth.\nPhillips dental materials 12th edition page no 174"

Negative immune regulationNobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine jointly, has been awarded to James P. Allison/Tasuku Honjo for their discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation.James P. Allison studied a known protein that functions as a brake on the immune system. He realized the potential of releasing the brake and thereby unleashing our immune cells to attack tumors.Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-associated Antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoints are negative regulators of T-cell immune function. Inhibition of these targets, resulting in increased activation of the immune system, has led to new immunotherapies for melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and other cancers.For several types of cancer, including lung cancer, renal cancer, lymphoma and melanoma checkpoint therapy against PD-1 has proven more effective and positive results found.But recent clinical studies indicate that for melanoma the combination therapy of both CTLA-4 and PD-1 is more effective.Thus, Allison and Honjo combine different strategies to release the brakes on the immune system with the aim of eliminating tumor cells even more efficiently.Their paper formed the basis of current cancer immunotherapy.But the original concept of cancer immunotherapy was discovered by William Bradley Coley (1872)."

At end of 1 month of regular intake of drugs deterioration in sensorium is noted in condition of the patient despite good compliance for drugs. Which of the following investigations is not required as emergency condition? CSF examination. Here is an additional explanation: Answer- C. CSF examinationAltered sensorium might be due to raised intracranial tension and lumbar punctare can precipitate the ominous herniation of the brain. So, lumbar puncture (for CSF examination) is not required on emergency evaluation in the above mentioned patient.Altered sensorium in a patient of Turbercular meningitis, who was taking ATT from the last one month maybe due toHepatic encephalopathy secondary to hepatotoxicity of ATT. Hence, LFT should be performed.Diagnosis:Lumbar puncture is cornerstone of diagnosis (should not be done in cases or raised ICT).CSF examination reveals high leukocyte counto (usually predominance of lymphocytes but often with a predominance of neutrophils in the early stage), a protein content of I to 8 g/L (100 to 800 mg/dl) and a low glucose concentration.Culture of CSF is diagnostic in 80% cases.CT or MRI may show hydrocephalus and abnormal enhancement of basal cisterns or ependyma."

The additive e\ufb00ect of tangential tensile stress induced in the porcelain by the intraoral force can exceed the tensile strength\u00a0of the porcelain and causes crack propagation in the porcelain veneer. When the contraction coe\ufb03cient of the porcelain is much lower than that of the metal (\u03b1P much lower than \u03b1M), porcelain cracking or metal-ceramic bond failure can occur near the metal-porcelain interface.

False True False True TrueEmergency care providers should check the victim's pulse for at least 5 seconds but no longer than 10 seconds. For children aged one to adolescence, the pulse should be checked at the carotid aery. In infants, the brachial pulse should be assessed.If there is a palpable pulse within 10 seconds, then a rescue breath should be given every 3 seconds. Breaths should last one second and the chest should be observed for visible rise. If the victim has an advanced airway, then the provider should administer breaths 10-12 times per minute.If the pulse is less than 60/minute, or if the victim has signs of poor perfusion after adequate ventilation and oxygenation, the provider should begin chest compressions. In the absence of a pulse, a lone rescuer should begin CPR with 30 high quality compressions followed by two breaths. If two healthcare providers are available, the cycle of compressions to breaths should be 15:2 (pediatrics).High quality compressions in CPR should be a minimum of 1/3 the AP diameter of the chest, or approximately 1 1/2 inches in infants (4 cm) and 2\" in children from age one to adolescence. The rate of compressions should be 100-120 per minute. Chest recoil should be complete between compressions.Pediatric compression is performed with the head of one hand over the lower 1/2 of the sternum, between the nipples. In infants, use two fingers, or use the thumb encircling technique if multiple providers are available"

Here is an additional explanation: Atresia of the tricuspid valve results in the absence of a communication between the right atrium and right ventricle therefore the right ventricle is underdeveloped the inflow portion being absent.\nThe only exit for systemic venous blood coming to the right atrium is by way ofAtrial Septal defect. Through this the blood goes to left atrium from where it enters left ventricle.\nA ventricular septal defect provides communication between the left ventricle and the outflow portion of the right ventricle. The left ventricle therefore maintain both the systemic as well as the pulmonary circulation thus there is hypertrophy of the left ventricle which is reflected by left axis deviation in ECG.\nThe pulmonary blood flow is dependent on the size of the ventricular defect, the smaller the VSD, the lesser the pulmonary blood flow. 90% patients of Triscuspid Atresia have diminished pulmonary blood flow.\nAuscultatory finding in case of Tricuspid Atresia -'\n\n\nS 1- Normal\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 o SZ - Single\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 o Murmur grade III to grade 1111 / VI"

If father is also NESTROFT positive, confirmatory test for HbA2 is done for father.\nIf both the parents have thalessemia trait, there is 1:4 chance of fetus having thalassemia major.\nTherefore, prenatal diagnosis is done by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) in first trimester.\nIf CVS confirms the fetus to be having thalasemia major, termination of pregnancy is indicated after counseling the parents.\nIf the fetus has thalassemia minor (trait) pregnancy is continued as such and baby will have normal lifespan.\nIt is worth noting here that a positive NESTROFT test is seen in other conditions beside beta thalassemia trait. These are iron deficiency anemia, alpha thalassemia trait, homozygous and heterozygous HbE, HbS as well as hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin.\n\nTherefore, a positive NESTROFT test should always be followed by a confirmatory test for HBA2 ( eg. serum electrophoresis)."

Abdomen is entered a middle incision and if exsanguinating hemorrhage is encountered four quadrant packing should be performed Any violation of GI tract should be treated with suture closure or segmental stapled resection External drains are placed to control any major pancreatic or biliary injuries. Following completion of the initial exploration the critically ill patients is transferred to the ICU Invasive monitoring & complete ventilator suppo are often needed. This phase focusses on secondary resuscitation to correct hypothermia, coagulopathy & acidosis It consists of planned re-exploration & definitive repair of injuries. This phase typically occurs 48 & 72 hours following initial and after successful secondary resuscitation Abdomen should be closed primarily if possible Risky GI anastomoses or complex reconstruction should be avoided STAGES OF DCS Stage I Patient selection Stage II Operative control of haemorrhage & Contamination Stage III ICU resuscitation Stage IV Definitive surgery Stage V Abdominal closure"

On investigation, Guthrie test was found to be positive. All are true regarding this disease EXCEPT: White patch of hair due to tryptophan deficiency. Here is an additional explanation: This is Phenyl-ketonuria. Guthrie's bacterial inhibition test is a screening test for phenylketonuria (PKU), used to detect the abnormal presence of phenylalanine metabolites in blood i.e. Phenyl pyruvate, Phenyl alanine & Phenyl-lactate. FeCl3 detects phenyl alanine levels in urine. WITH REGARDS TO OTHER OPTIONS In Phenylketonuria, Phenylalanine is accumulated due to deficiency of enzyme Phenylalanine Hydroxylase. As a result Phenylalanine is not conveed to Tyrosine and is responsible for mental retardation in patients. Tyrosine becomes essential in these patients. CILINICAL MANIFESTATION CNS - Mental retardation, failure to walk and talk, growth retardation, seizures, tremors, microcephaly. Pigmentation - melanin is synthesized from tyrosine. so in PKU melanin is less result in hypopigmentation that cause light skin colour, blue eyes, fair hair Treatment - low phenylalanine content diet"

Check serum estradiol levels. Here is an additional explanation: Answer- B. Check serum estradiol levelsLH and FSH levels by the third montlt of pregnancy are steady st a low level. HCG takes over tlte function of LH after feilization and inhibils production on LH . Inhibin A produced by fetal trophoblasts suppresses maternal FSH secretion. Hence, 3 times elevation of LH and FSH points towards premature ovariun failure. Serum estradiol levels should be measured to confirm the diognosis"

        "generated_explanation": "A child is admitted on 7 days of life with severe respiratory distress and shock. He was discharged 2 days back healthy. What could be the probable diagnosis \u2013 Hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Here is an additional explanation: livpolastic left heart syndrome \n\nHypoplastic left heart syndrome occurs when parts of the left side of the heart (mitral valve, left ventricle, aortic valve, and aorta) do not develop completely. The condition is present at birth (congenital).\nHypoplastic left heart is a rare type of congenital heart disease. It is more common in males than in females. As with most congenital heart defects, there is no known cause. About 10 % of patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome also have other birth defects.\nThe problem develops before birth when the left ventricle and other structures do not grow properly, including the:\n\n(i) Aorta-the blood vessel that carries oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle to the entire body\nEntrace and exit of the ventricle\nMitral and aortic valves\n\nThis causes the left ventricle and aorta to be poorly developed, or hypoplastic. In most cases, the left ventricle and aorta are much smaller than normal.\nIn patients with this condition, the left side of the heart is unable to send enough blood to the body. As a result, the right side of the heart must maintain the circulation for both the lungs and the body. The right ventricle can support the circulation to both the lungs and the body for awhile, but this extra workoad eventually causes the right side of the heart to fail.\nThe only possibility of survival is a connection between the right and left side of the heart, or between the systemic\n\narteries and pumonary arteries (the blood vessels that carry blodd to the lungs). Babies are normally born with two\nof these connections:\n(i) Foramen ovale (a hole between the right and left atrium)\nDuctus arteriosus (a small vessel that connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery)\n\nBoth of these connections normally close on their own a few days after birth.\nIn babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, blood from the right side of the heart travels through the ductus arteriosus. This is the only way for blood to get to the body. if the ductus arteriosus is allowed to close in a baby with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the patient may quickly die because no blood will be pumped to the body.\nBabies with known hypoplatic left heart syndrome are usually started on a medicine to keep the ductus arteriosusopen.\nBecause there is little or no flow out of the left heart, blood reaming to the heart from the lungs needs to pass through the foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect (a hole connecting the collecting chambers on the left and right sides of the heart) back to the right side of the heart. If there is no foramen ovale, or if it is too small, the baby could die. Patients with this problem have the hole between their atria opened, either with surgery or using a thin, flexible tube (heart catheterization).\n\nSymptoms\n\nAt first, a newborn with hypoplastic left heart may apper normal. Symptoms usually occur in the first few hours of life, although it may take up to a few days to develop symptoms. These symptoms may include:\n\n\nBluish (cyanosis) or poor skin color\nCold hands and feed (extremities)\n\n\nLethargy\n\n\nPoor pulse\nPoor suckling and feeding\nPounding heart\nRapid breathing\nShortness of breath.\nSince the systemic circulation is dependent on the patent ductus arteriosus the closure of ductus arterious leads to shock.\nSigns of heart failure usually appears within the first few days or weeks of life and include dyspnoea, hepatomegaly and low cardiac output. When PDA closes suddenly shock occurs all the peripheral pulses may be weak or absent.\n\nVentricular septal defect\n\nThese patients with VSD's become symptomatic around 6-10 weeks of age.\nThey usually present with congestive cardiac failure.\n\nEbstein's anomaly \n\nEbstein's anomaly consists of downward displacement of an abnormal tricuspid value into the right ventricle.\nThese patients usually present in teenage/adolescent years.\nThey may also present in infancy but they usually do not present with shock or severe hypoperfusion.\n\nAorticopulmonary window defect\n\nAn Aorticopulmanry window defect consists of a communication between the ascending Aorta and the main pulmonary artery.\nIn these cases minimal cyanosis is present and they may present with heart failure in infancy."

The condition has a racial predilection; it is more common in Jews and Japenese people, and most cases are of genetic origin.Patients with degenerative myopia typically complain of decreased vision, headaches, and sensitivity to light. If retinal degeneration or detachment is present, patients may also repo light flashes and floaters, which are associated with retina changes. Those with degenerative myopia have an increased incidence of cataract formation (nuclear cataracts are most typical).Some of the most typical features of degenerative myopia are:Vitreous liquefaction and posterior vitreous detachmentPeripapillary atrophy appearing as temporal choroidal or scleral crescents or rings around the optic discLattice degeneration in the peripheral retinaTilting or malinseion of the optic disc, usually associated with myopic conusThinning of the retinal pigment epithelium with resulting atrophic appearance of the fundusEctasia of the sclera posteriorly (posterior staphyloma)Breaks in Bruch's membrane and choriocapillaris, resulting in lines across the fundus called \"lacquer cracks\"Fuchs spot in the macular area."

What would be the appropriate treatment protocol for this patient? Wait and watch for 6 years. Here is an additional explanation: When the facial growth pattern is viewed against the perspective of the cephalocaudal gradient, it is not surprising that the mandible, being farther away from the brain, tends to grow more and later than the maxilla, which is closer.\nGrowth of the mandible continues at a relatively steady rate before puberty. Ramus height increases 1\u00a0to 2 mm per year and body length increases 2 to 3 mm per year. These cross-sectional data tend to smooth out the juvenile and pubertal growth spurts, which do occur in growth of the mandible.\nGrowth in length and height of both jaws continues through the period of puberty.\nSince the age of the child is less than 6 years and growth spurts are yet to occur. So at this point of time, in this patient, the best treatment protocol will be wait and watch.\nRef: Proffit 4th Edition"

General anesthesia with IV induction by ketamine(Ref Williams 24/e p516; Morgan 4/e p197-199)This patient of placenta pre is in labor and has bled into shock.She should be delivered by cesarean section under general anesthesia.General anesthesia is preferred as it is a more controllable modality and there is a significant risk of hypotension associated with spinal anesthesia.Ketamine is the preferred agent in cases of acute shock.Stimulates sympathetic system causing tachycardia and hypeension, so it is intravenous anaesthetic of choice for shock."

Here is an additional explanation: \"Respiratory distress in an infant along with a positive family history of similarly affected newborn infants strongly suggests, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis\".\nPulmonary alveolar proteinosis \n\nPulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a disorder characterized by the intraalveolar accumulation of pulmonary surfactant.\nTwo clinically distinct forms of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis are seen -\n\n\nFatal form\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -->\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Presenting shortly after birth (congenital PAP)\n\nu Gradually progressive form -->\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Presenting in older infants and children\nPathology\n\nAlthough the mechanisms that lead to alveolar proteinosis are undefined, histological findings suggests that they result in a disruption of pulmonary surfactant metabolism.\nThe main surface tension lowering agent in surfactant is phospholipids le. primary dipalmitol phosphatidyl choline.\nHowever DPCC needs surfactant protein (in endogenous and natural surfactants) for efficient dispersion which enables the formation of a phospholipid monolayer on the alveolar surface.\nThere are two surfactant proteins present in the body i.e., protein A and protein B.\nIn pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, there is absence of protein B.\nIn the absence of protein B, the rapid spread and absorption of the phospholipid (DPCC) does not take place so they cannot form a phospholipid monolayer on the alveolar surface.\nThis in turn leads to failure of expansion of alveoli leading to poor cardiorespiratory adaptation at birth.\n\nClinical manifestation -\n\nThis disorder is immediately apparent in the newborn period and rapidly leads to respiratory failure.\nCongenital pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is clinically and radiographically indistinguishable from more common disorders of the newborn that lead to respiratory failure including pneumonia, generalized bacterial infection, respiratory distress syndrome and total anomalous pulmonary venous return with obstruction.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nHistopathological examination of lung biopsy specimen is the gold standard for diagnosis.\nOn histopathological examination distal air spaces are filled with a granular, eosinophillic material that stains\n\npositively with periodic - acid schiff reagent and is diastase resistant.\nTreatment\n\nUntreated, alveolar proteinosis in newborns is rapidly fatal and no successful medical therapy has been developed.\nRepeated bronchoalveolar lavage is a temporizing measure.\nLung transplantation is the only therapeutic option but its use is limited by concerns about disease recurrence."

Poor Preoperative preparation of the patientThis is a rare but life-threatening complication of thyrotoxicosis.The most prominent signs are fever, agitation, delirium, tachycardia or atrial fibrillation and, in the older patient, cardiac failure. Thyrotoxic crisis is a medical emergency and has a moality of 10% despite early recognition and treatment.It is most commonly precipitated by an infection in a patient with previously unrecognized or inadequately treated thyrotoxicosis.It may also develop in known thyrotoxicosis sholy after thyroidectomy in an ill-prepared patient or within a few days of 131I therapy, when acute radiation damage may lead to a transient rise in serum thyroid hormone levels.Patients should be rehydrated and given propranolol, either orally (80 mg 4 times daily) or intravenously (1-5 mg 4 times daily). Sodium iodate (500 mg per day orally) will restore serum T3 levels to normal in 48-72 hours.This is a radiographic contrast medium that not only inhibits the release of thyroid hormones but also reduces the conversion of T4 to T3 and is, therefore, more effective than potassium iodide or Lugol's solution."

They increase bronchial responsiveness to salbutamol. Here is an additional explanation: Ans. b. They increase bronchial responsiveness to salbutamol Coicosteroids has a dual effect in acute asthma with an early facilitator effect on airway beta-2 adrenoreceptor sensitivity and a later effect on airway inflammation, which fuher emphasizes the need fir coicosteroids to he administered as early as possible during an acute asthma attack.\"he molecular mechanism of action of coicosteroids involves several effects on the inflammatory process. The major effect of coicosteroids is to switch off the transcription of multiple activated genes that encode inflammatory proteins such as cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and inflammatory enzymes. This effect involves several mechanisms, including inhibition of the transcription factor NF-KB, but an impoant mechanism is recruitment of HDAC2 to the inflammatory gene complex, which reverses the histone acetylation associated with increased gene transcription. Coicosteroids also activate anti-inflammatory genes, such as mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatase-1, and increase the expression of IQ-receptors. Most of the metabolic and endocrine side effects of coicosteroids are also mediated through transcriptional activation."

HHV-8 infection is more common in pas of Africa than in the United States. Primary HHV-8 infection in immunocompetent children may manifest as fever and maculopapular rash. Among individuals with intact immunity, chronic asymptomatic infection is the rule, and neoplastic disorders generally develop only after subsequent immunocompromise. In patients with AIDS, effective antiretroviral therapy has caused improvement in HHV-8-related disease. The virus is sensitive to ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir, but the clinical benefit has not been demonstrated in trials.

This is called breastmilk jaundice.\nA bilirubin level of over 20 mg/dl may be attained. (It is presumed to be due to inhibitory substances in the breastmilk that interfere with bilirubin conjugation e.g. pregananediol and free fatty acids).\nTemporary interruption of breastmilk feeds will dramatically reduce the serum levels of bilirubin and there may be slight increase in bilirubin when breast feeding is resumed, but it never reaches the previous levels. Hypothyroidism \u00a0\nPersistent elevation of indirect bilirubin is the first sign of congenital hypothyroidism in neonates.\nThis is due to decreased activity of UDPGT for weeks or months after birth.\nAt least 10% of all infants with congenital hypothyroidism will have jaundice as the presenting symptom.\nTreatment with thyroxine promptly alleviates jaundice.\n\nG-6PD deficiency \n\nThere is hemolytic anemia that results in increased production of unconjugated bilirubin."

Here is an additional explanation: Absolute refractory period: The period during which 2nd action potential cannot be elicited, even with strong stimulus is called \"ABSOLUTE REFRACTORY PERIOD\". Reason for this restriction is that sholy after action potential is initiated, the sodium channels (or calcium channels / both) become inactivated & no amount of excitatory signal applied to these channels at this point will open inactivated gates. Only condition that will allow them to reopen is when membrane potential returns to or gets close to original resting membrane potential level. Then, within another small fraction of second, inactivated gates of channels open & new action potential can be initiated This period for large myelinated nerve fibers is about 1/2500 second thus, such fibers can transmit maximum of about 2500 impulses per second - Na have 2 gates, activated gate & an inactivated gate. At resting state - active gate - closed - inactive gate - open At stimulus - both gates are open At absolute refractory period - active gate - open; inactive gate - closed Next action potential is generated only after inactivated gate is open & both gates go back to resting state."

Psoas abscesses may arise from a hematogenous source, by contiguous spread from an intra- abdominal or pelvic process, or by contiguous spread from nearby bony structures (e.g., veebral bodies). Associated osteomyelitis due to spread from bone to muscle or from muscle to bone is common in psoas abscesses. When pott's disease was common, Mycobacterium tuberculosis was a frequent cause of psoas abscess. Currently, either S. aureus or a mixture of enteric organisms including aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli is usually isolated from psoas abscesses in the United States. S. aureus is most likely to be isolated when a psoas abscess arises from hematogenous spread or a contiguous focus of osteomyelitis; a mixed enteric flora is the most likely etiology when the abscess has an intra- abdominal or pelvic source. Patients with psoas abscesses frequently present with fever, lower abdominal or back pain, or pain referred to the hip or knee. CT is the most useful diagnostic technique.\"- Harrison 19/e p852 \"Spinal TB (Pott's disease or tuberculous spondylitis) often involves two or more adjacent veebral bodies. Whereas the upper thoracic spine is the most common site of spinal TB in children, the lower thoracic and upper lumbar veebrae are usually affected in adults. From the anterior superior or inferior angle of the veebral body, the lesion slowly reaches the adjacent body, later affecting the interveebral disk. With advanced disease, collapse of veebral bodies results in kyphosis (gibbus). A paraveebral \"cold\" abscess may also form. In the upper spine, this abscess may track to and penetrate the chest wall, presenting as a soft tissue mass; in the lower spine, it may reach the inguinal ligaments or present as a psoas abscess. \"Harrison 19/e p1110"

Probable diagnosis is: TV endocarditis due to Staph. aureus. Here is an additional explanation: Infective endocarditis typically occurs at sites of pre-existing endocardial damage, but infection with particularly virulent or aggressive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus can cause endocarditis in a previously normal heart. Staphylococcal endocarditis of the tricuspid valve is a common complication of intravenous drug use. Many acquired and congenital cardiac lesions are vulnerable, particularly areas of endocardial damage caused by a high-pressure jet of blood, such as ventricular septal defect, mitral regurgitation and aortic regurgitation, many of which are haemodynamically insigni\ufb01cant. In contrast, the risk of endocarditis at the site of haemodynamically important low-pressure lesions, such as a large atrial septal defect, is minimal.\nReference: : Davidson 23rd ed page no 527"

D/D Atrial fibrillation Multifocal atrial tachycardia P wave absent P wave present Variable RR interval Therefore ruled out P wave varying amplitual and answer is MAT. Trick to solve: First check if patient has tachycardia/bradycardia RR interval Narrow QRS suggests supraventricular tachycardia COPD is the reason for multifocal atrial tachycardia due to right ventricular strain causing RV enlargement causing right axis duration. Visible P wave variable amplitude RR interval changing Narrow QRS All point towards diagnosis of multifocal atrial tachycardia. Monomorphic VT is ruled out as it has broad QRS complex. Between MAT & AV nodal reentrant tachycardia the H/o smokers narrows down the diagnosis to MAT."

The amount of maxillary movement is influenced by a number of factors like:\n\nAmount of force:\u00a0Successful maxillary protraction can be brought about by 300-500 gm of force per side in the primary or mixed dentition.\nDirection of force:\u00a0According to most authors,\u00a0a 15- 20\u00b0 downward pull to the occlusal plane is required to produce forward maxillary movement.\n\tIn most cases of maxillary deficiency, maxilla is deficient in the vertical plane as well, therefore, a slight downward, direction of force is usually desirable. The line of force passes below the center of resistance of the maxilla producing a counter-clockwise moment on the maxilla and dentition. This results in a possible extrusion of maxillary posterior teeth leading to a downward and backward rotation of the mandible.\n\tHowever, in patients with increased anterior facial height, downward pull is contradicted.\nDuration of force:\u00a0A review of literature shows duration to vary between 3 and 16 months. On an average at least 8-12 months of wear is required to produce the desired effect.\nFrequency of use:\u00a012-14 hrs/day.\n\nKey Concept:\nAccording to most authors, a\u00a015- 20\u00b0 downward pull to the occlusal plane is required to produce forward maxillary movement.\nReference: Textbook of orthodontics 2nd ed Gurkeerat Singh page no 502"

Here is an additional explanation: Down's\u00a0analysis provides information by which we can determine whether the individual\u2019s pattern shows comparatively harmonious relations or not and whether dysplasia present in a person is in the facial skeleton, the dentition or in both.\nSteiner concluded that it might not be possible to correct dentition according to ideal norms in non-growing patients whose skeletal relations cannot be altered. The imperative here is to come up with an acceptable compromise for the dentition, one that will mask the underlying skeletal deformity as much as possible. This can be achieved using Steiner\u2019s sticks, which allow calculations to be carried out for a particular ANB value.\nIn addition to commonly used sagittal discrepancy indicators, that is angle ANB, sagittal maxilla mandibular relationship should be reconfirmed with other variables which include WITS appraisal, A\u2013B plane angle and beta angle.\u00a0\nKey Concept:\nTweed\u2019s analysis (originally undertaken in 1954) is primarily based on inclination of the mandibular incisors to the basal bone and the latter\u2019s association with the vertical relation of the mandible to the cranium. Tweed\u2019s analysis is clinically oriented. It does not directly assess the jaws.\n\u00a0\nReference: Orthodontics: Diagnosis and Management of Malocclusion and Dentofacial Deformities 3rd O P Kharbanda, pdf no 1016,997,981,2463"

Infectious myositis has a male predominance and are typically seen in young adults. The typical presentation of the childhood form includes fever, malaise, and rhinorrhea which is usually followed in 1-7 days by severe pain, especially in the calves. The muscle pain is usually worse with movement and the symptoms last for about a week. Muscle weakness, tenderness, and swelling are usually seen with more severity in adults and the Proximal muscles are affected predominantly.In children, toe walking and wide-based gait may be seen because of the involvement of the gastrocnemius-soleus muscles.

B: Obstruction of lymphatic ductsInflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a very aggressive type of breast cancer in which the cancer cells block the lymph vessels in the skin of the breast.This type of breast cancer is called \"inflammatory\" because the breast often looks swollen and red, or \"inflamed\", sometimes overnight, and can be misdiagnosed as mastitis.Invasion of the local lymphatic ducts impairs drainage and causes edematous swelling of the breast. Because the skin of the breast is tethered by the suspensory ligament of Cooper, the accumulation of fluid may cause the skin of the breast to assume a dimpled appearance similar to an orange peel (peau d'orange).IBC is sometimes misdiagnosed as an insect bite or breast infection. In the case of IBC, a lump is usually not present as in other forms of breast cancer."

Here BP is 150/100, (Therefore, it is not necessary to start antihypertensive). The NICE clinical guidelines suggest treating moderate hypertension (BP-150/100-159/109 mm Hg) with antihypertensives to keep B I P <150/80-100 range. The benefits or disadvantages of this intervention have not been elucidated by adequate clinical trials.\nFernando Arias 4/e, p 209.\n\u201cThere is a consensus that if BP is below 150/100 mm Hg, there is no need for antihypertensive therapy. An exception may be if mild hypertension is associated with markers of potential severe disease or sign of organ dysfunction, (heavy proteinuria, liver dysfunction, hematological dysfuntion)\u201d.\nFernando Arias 4/e, p 209.\nThus, in this patient, the role of antihypertensive is not confirmatory as BP is 150/100 mm Hg. But role of induction of labor is confirmed, as patient is 37 weeks pregnant with mild hypertension.\nPIH is not a contraindication for VBAC (Vaginal birth after cesarean) and further more that the pelvis of this patient is adequate \u2013 so there is no harm in inducing labour, rather it is advantageous, because it will help in developing lower uterine segment. At any point of time; if there is scar tenderness or if patients BP rises immediately perform cesarean section\u2019 therefore the best answer here is \u2013 Antihypertensive regime and then induce labour"

Here is an additional explanation: As per ACOG and RCOG guidelines, there is no particular drug of choice for epilepsy in pregnancy\nValproate increases chances of birth defects much more than phenytoin, carbamazepine or phenobarbitone and hence if valproate is being used, it should be substituted by a lesser teratogenic drug.\nNow in this question:\nA 26-year-old primigravida with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy who has been using valproic acid comes to you at fourth month of pregnancy for advice.\nLogically speaking if patient has myoclonic epilepsy in non pregnant states-DOC is valproic acid \u2014Harrsion 18/e, p 3266 or lamotrigine, so her physician must have prescribed valproic acid to her. Ideally valproic acid should not be used during pregnancy as it is associated with a high risk of congenital malformations in the fetus. So if this patient would have come in the first trimester, I would have substituted it with some other antiepileptic drug like lamotrigine."

Here is an additional explanation: Well friends, we have discussed the causes and investigations of DIC. Now here let\u2019s take a look at its management.\\\nManagement of DIC\n\nThe most important step is to terminate the pregnancy- vaginal delivery without episiotomy is preferred to cesarean section\nVolume replacement by crystalloids or colloids will reduce the amount of whole blood needed to restore the blood volume.\n500 ml of fresh blood raises the fibrinogen level approximately by 12.5 mg/100 ml and platelets by 10,000\u201315,000 cu mm. Fresh blood- helps in flushing out fibrin degradation product and improving the micro circulation.\nTo replace fibrinogen- Fresh frozen plasma should be given: Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is extracted from whole blood. It contains fibrinogen, anti-thrombin III, clotting factors V, XI, XII. FFP transfusion provides both volume replacement and coagulation factors. One unit of FFP (250 mL) raises the fibrinogen by 5-10 mg/dL. FFP does not need to be ABO or Rh compatible.\nCryoprecipitate is obtained from thawed FFP. It is rich in fibrinogen, factor VIII, Von Willebrand\u2019s factor, and XIII. Cryoprecipitate provides less volume (40 mL) compared to FFP (250 mL). So it should not be used for volume replacement. One unit of cryoprecipitate increases the fibrinogen level by 5-10 mg/dL.\nIn case of active bleeding with platelet counts < 50,000/ml or prophylactically with platelet count 20\u201330,000/ml \u2013 platelet replacement should be done. Platelet should ABO and Rh specific. 1 units (50 ml) raises the platelet count by 7500/ ml\nRecombinant activated factors VIIA: (60-100 \u03bcg/kg IV) can reverse DIC within 10 minute as it is a precusor for extrinsic clotting cascade which is replaced.\nRole of Heparin\n\nAccording to Williams Obs. \u201cHeparin is not used in DIC.\u201d\nAccording to COGDT 10/e, p 999\n\u201cHeparin acts as an anticoagulant by activating antithrombin III but has little effect on activated coagulation factors. Anticoagulation is contraindicated in patients with fulminant DIC and central nervous system insults, fulminant liver failure, or obstetric accidents. The one instance, however, in which heparin has been demonstrated to benefit pregnancy-related DIC is in the case of the retained dead fetus with intact vascular system, where heparin may be administered to interrupt the coagulation process and thrombocytopenia for several days until delivery may be implemented.\u201d\nAs far as EACA is concerned- Williams Obs. 22/e, p 844 says \u2013\n\u201cEACA is not recommended in case of DIC.\u201d\nAccording to Williams Obs 23/e, p 787\n\u201cIt use in most types of obstetric coagulopathy has not been efficacious & not recommended\u201d"

Blood vessel radius, 2. Vasodilatation/vasoconstriction.* Thus ultimately, if parameter values remain constant, - Resistance to blood flow is inversely propoional to the 4th power of radius."

        "generated_explanation": "In which of the following conditions would maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein values be the highest: Gastroschisis. Here is an additional explanation: Friends, many questions are asked on serum alpha fetoprotein, therefore basic knowledge of this protein is quite vital.\nAlpha Fetoprotein:\n\nIt is a glycoprotein\u00a0synthesized by the fetal yolk sac\u00a0in the early weeks of gestation and by the gastrointestinal tract\u00a0and liver\u00a0later.\nIt is the most abundant protein in the fetal serum.\nIt circulates in fetal serum and passes into fetal urine and amniotic fluid.\nConcentration of AFP increases steadily in fetal serum till 13 weeks, (3 mg/ml) after which the level rapidly decreases throughout the rest of pregnancy.\nAFP level in fetal serum declines following birth and by one year of age, its concentration is 1 ng/ml which persists throughout life.\nAFP passes from the fetus to amniotic fluid when fetus passes urine.\nIt passes into the maternal serum by diffusion across the placental membranes and via placental circulation and is found in steadily increasing quantities in maternal serum after 12 weeks.\n\nThese are the usual ways of entry of serum alfa fetoprotein in maternal serum but serum alfa fetoprotein can find its way in maternal serum in other ways too.\n\nOpen fetal body wall defects uncoverd by integument permit allows additional AFP to leak into the amniotic fluid and thus maternal serum AFP are increased. This is the reason for increase in serum alpha fetoprotein in neural tube defects and ventral wall defects.\nMaternal screening is done between 15-20 weeks (according to Williams 23/e, p 289, Fernando Arias 3/e, p 58).\nIt is measured in nanograms per ml and reported as a multiple of the median (MOM).\nMSAFP of 2.5 MOM is considered as the upper limit of normal (for twin pregnancy it is 3.5 MOM).\n\nNow after having this basic knowledge lets have a look at the question.\nIn the question alpha fetoprotein will be increased in the following conditions.\n\nGastroschisis \u2013 Ventral wall defect\nOmphalocele \u2013 Ventral wall defect\nSpina bifida occulta \u2013 Neural tube defect\n\nIn Down\u2019s syndrome - AFP levels are decreased.\nSpina bifida occulta:\nSpina bifida occulta is usually a small, clinically asymptomatic defect, covered by skin, so there are less chances of mixing of fetal serum and maternal serum. Therefore the maternal serum alphafetoprotein level usually does not increase in spina bifida occulta.\n\u201cIn the fetus with a defect such as anencephaly or spina bifida, AFP enters the amniotic fluid in increased amounts, leading to higher levels in the maternal serum as well. Levels of AFP are elevated in amniotic fluid and maternal serum only when such lesions are \u201copen,\u201d i.e., when the neural tissue is exposed or covered by only a thin membrane. When NTDs are skin-covered, AFP does not escape from the fetal circulation, and such defects are generally not detected by maternal serum AFP (MSAFP) screening\u201d.\nUSG in Obs. and Gyane by Callen 4/e, p 25\nOmphalocele:\u00a0\nFernando Arias 3/e, p 84\nIt is a midline defect of the anterior abdominal wall characterized by herniation of the abdominal viscera into the base of the umbilical cord.\nThe protruding organs are typically covered by a thin aminoperitoneal membrane. Omphalocele has a strong association with high levels of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein because the ventral wall defect allows mixing of fetal and maternal circulation.\nGastroschisis:\nFernando Arias 2/e, p 83\nGastroschisis is a paraumbilical defect of the anterior abdominal wall, through which abdominal viscera herniates. The defect is usually located on the right side of the cord insertion and compromises the full thickness of the abdominal wall. There is no sac or membrane covering the herniated organs. This defect is associated with high alpha feto protein titre.\nBoth gastroschisis and omphalocele are ventral wall defects containing abdominal organs and both are associated with high alphafetoprotein level in maternal serum.\nBut it is likely that alphafetoprotein level will be higher in patients with gastroschisis as there is no sac or membrane which covers the herniated organs in this defect. So there is more possibility of fetoprotein leak into the maternal serum or amniotic fluid in Gastroschisis. The answer is further supported by the following graph from\nUSG in Obs. and Gynae by Callen 4/e, p 28"

Here is an additional explanation: Infective endocarditis typically occurs at sites of pre-existing endocardial damage, but infection with particularly virulent or aggressive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus can cause endocarditis in a previously normal heart. Staphylococcal endocarditis of the tricuspid valve is a common complication of intravenous drug use. Many acquired and congenital cardiac lesions are vulnerable, particularly areas of endocardial damage caused by a high-pressure jet of blood, such as ventricular septal defect, mitral regurgitation and aortic regurgitation, many of which are haemodynamically insigni\ufb01cant. In contrast, the risk of endocarditis at the site of haemodynamically important low-pressure lesions, such as a large atrial septal defect, is minimal.\nRef: Davidson 23rd ed page no 527"

B: Normal HbF and normal HbA2Alpha (0) thalassemia -Individuals with this disorder are not able to produce any functional alpha-globin and thus are unable to make any functional hemoglobin A, F, or A2. This leads to the development of hydrops fetalis, also known as hemoglobin Ba, a condition that is incompatible with extra uterine life.Alpha (+) thalassemia - genetic mutations that result in decreased production of alpha-globin usually due to the functional deletion of 1 of the 4 alpha globin genes. Based on the number of inherited alpha genes, it is subclassified into 3 general forms:Thalassemia (-u/ a a) is characterized by inheritance of 3 normal a-genes. These patients are referred to clinically as silent carrier of alpha thalassemia. Other names for this condition are alpha thalassemia minima, alpha thalassemia-2 trait, and heterozygosity for alpha (+) thalassemia minor. The affected individuals exhibit no abnormality clinically and may be hematologically normal or have mild reductions in red cell mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH).Inheritance of 2 normal alpha genes due to either heterozygosity for alpha (0) thalassemia (u a/ --) or homozygosity for alpha (+) thalassemia (-u/-a) results in the development of alpha thalassemia minor or alpha thalassemia-1 trait. The affected individuals are clinically normal but frequently have minimal anemia and reduced mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH).Inheritance of one normal alpha gene (-a/ --) results in abundant formation of hemoglobin H. This condition is known as ElbH disease. The affected individuals have moderate to severe lifelong hemolytic anemia, modest degrees of ineffective erythropoiesis, splenomegaly and variable bony changesPersons with alpha-thalassemia traits have normal HbA2 and HbF levels whereas beta- thalassemia patients have elevated HbA2"

Here is an additional explanation: Aim for the treatment of classical angina is decrease in work of hea. It can be accomplished by decrease in preload, decrease in afterload or decrease in hea rate. Nitrates act by production of nitric oxide (NO). NO stimulates guanylate cyclase in smooth muscles which leads to formation of cGMP. Later acts on smooth muscles to cause vasodilation. Nitrates mainly produce NO in veins leading to its predominant action as venodilation. Dilation of veins results in decrease in pre-load. Therefore major mechanism of action of nitrates in angina is decrease in preload. However, in variant angina these drugs benefit by causing coronary vasodilation as variant angina occurs due to vasospasm of coronary aery."

To decrease secretions. Here is an additional explanation: Preanaesthetic medication refers to the use of drugs before anaesthesia to make it safe and less unpleasant. When inhalation anaesthetic are given they inhibit the ciliary function therefore secretions in the respiratory pathway are not removed so we have to stop the secretions by administration of anti cholinergic drugs like atropine or glycopyrrolate. Glycopyrrolate is twice as potent and longer acting quaternary antimuscarinic which does not produce central effects. Antisecretory action is more marked than atropine and tachycardia is less marked. It acts rapidly when given i.v. and is the preferred antimuscarinic in anaesthetic practice."

Here is an additional explanation: Red cell precursors formed in the bone marrow from the erythroid (CFU\u2013E) progenitor cells are called erythroblasts or normoblasts. These divide and acquire haemoglobin, which turns the cytoplasm pink; the nucleus condenses and is extruded from the cell. The \ufb01rst non-nucleated red cell is a reticulocyte, which still contains ribosomal material in the cytoplasm, giving these large cells a faint blue tinge (\u2018polychromasia\u2019). Reticulocytes lose their ribosomal material and mature over 3 days, during which time they are released into the circulation. Increased numbers of circulating reticulocytes (reticulocytosis) reflect increased erythropoiesis.\nProliferation and differentiation of red cell precursors is stimulated by erythropoietin, a polypeptide hormone produced by renal interstitial peritubular cells in response to hypoxia. Failure of erythropoietin production in patients with renal failure causes anaemia, which can be treated with exogenous recombinant erythropoietin or similar pharmacological agents called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, e.g. darbepoetin.\nReference: : Davidson P R I N C I P L E S\u00a0 \u00a0and Practice O F M E D I C I N E 23rd edition page no\u00a0 915"

Here is an additional explanation: All the options given in the question lead to mercury toxicity.\nMethyl mercury is the most common form that is transformed by natural processes; it is a more toxic form than ethyl mercury (C2H5Hg+) or elemental mercury. Methyl mercury is a major safety concern because it bioaccumulates through the food chain; its pharmacokinetic half-life is longer (1.5 to 3 months) than that of ethyl mercury (less than 1 week). In air, the concentrations of mercury range from about 0.01 to 0.02 \u00b5g/m3.\nMercury accumulates in the kidneys. In the brain, metallic mercury can be converted to an inorganic form that is retained in the brain. Elemental mercury and mercury vapor have a half-life of 1 to 3 months. Mercury leaves the body by excretion through urine and feces.\nExposure to high levels of mercury can injure the brain, kidneys, and developing fetus. Chronic mercury toxicity may be manifested as tremors; memory loss; and changes in personality, vision, and hearing.\nReference: PHILLIPS\u2019 SCIENCE OF DENTAL MATERIALS, 12th ed page no 124"

Here is an additional explanation: Uterine rupture typically is classified as either complete (all layers of the uterine wall separated) or incomplete (uterine muscle separated but visceral peritoneum is intact). Incomplete rupture is commonly referred to as scar dehiscence.\nScar dehiscence is an intraoperative finding always. The greatest risk factor for either complete or incomplete uterine rupture is prior cesarean delivery.\nFollowing uterine rupture the most common electronic fetal monitoring finding is sudden, severe heart rate decelerations that may evolve into late decelerations, bradycardia, and undetectable fetal heart action.\nIn some cases in which the fetal presenting part has entered the pelvis with labor, loss of station may be detected by pelvic examination. If the fetus is partly or totally extruded from the site of uterine rupture, abdominal palpitation or vaginal examination may be helpful to identify the presenting part, which will have moved away from the pelvic inlet.\nA firm contracted uterus may at times be felt alongside the fetus. With rupture and expulsion of the fetus into the peritoneal cavity, the chances for intact fetal survival are dismal, and reported morality rates range from 50% to 75%.\nClinical features of Ruptured Uterus:"

Urea cycle disorders result in the accumulation of precursors of urea, principally ammonia and glutamine. Phenylbutyrate provides an alternate means of detoxfication of glutamine acetylation, which bypasses the urea cycle."

This is because:CNS neurons do not have the growth promoting chemical needed for the regenerationCNS myelin is a potent inhibitor of axonal growth.That is why treatment of brain and spinal cord injuries frequently focuses on rehabilitation rather than reversing the nerve damage. Following CNS injuries, several events which provide inappropriate environment for regeneration are:Astrocytic proliferationActivation of microgliaformationInflammationInvasion of immune cellsNew research is aiming to identify ways to initiate and maintain axonal growth, to direct regenerating axons to reconnect with their target neurons and to reconstitute original neuronal circuit."

It is produced by the adrenal glands, the gonads, and the brain.It is normally found in the form of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS).The body holds DHEAS in reserve and conves it to specific hormones when needed.It is impoant for creating estrogen and androgen sex hormones and contributes to the development of so-called androgenic effects, or masculinization.These changes include the production of oilier skin, changes in body odor, and the growth of armpit and pubic hair."

Papain hydrolyzes IgG at the hinge region, which lyses IgG into one constant Fc region and two Fab fragments.When studying the Ig molecule structure, it was identified experimentally thot an antibody molecule, such as IgG, can be split into two fragments by the proteolytic enzyme, papain. When this happens, the peptide bonds in the hinge region are broken.The antigen-binding activity is associated with one of these fragments, the Fab poion- The second fragment is the Fc poion that is involved in the placental transfer, complement fixation, attachment to various cells, and other biologic activities."

It is active against gram positive organisms* Tedizolid Phosphate is an oxazolidinone-class antibiotic prodrug indicated in adults for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) caused by susceptible isolates of several Gram-positive bacteria.* Following administration oral or intravenous route, tedizolid phosphate prodrug is conveed by plasma phosphatases to its active moiety, tedizolid.* The active metabolite of tedizolid binds to the 50S bacterial ribosomal subunit, inhibiting protein synthesis and causing its bacteriostatic effects.* Tedizolid is an effective and potent alternative to linezolid for the treatment of patients with Gram-positive ABSSSI due to MRSA or MSSA.* Increased potency allows for once daily dosing with reduced total dosages, improving the side effect profile of this drug.* Of note, the minimum inhibitory concentrations of tedizolid appear to be largely unaffected by the chloramphenicol-florfenicol resistance (cfr) gene, which has been implicated in a number of published linezolid-resistant organism outbreaks.* OPTIC NEUROPATHY,PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY ARE LESS SEEN WITH TEDIZOLID THAN OTHERS IN SAME CLASS"

This fetal hemoglobin disappears after 5 month of age so that by 5 months of age, the sickling of the red blood cells is prominent and symptoms begin.\nPNH is manfested in adults.\nSo, both PNH and sickle cell anemia does not cause jaundice since birth.\nBut among these two I would prefer PNH as the answer because it is manifested in adulthood while the patient in question is a 5-years old child.\nSickle cell anemia symptoms develop at the age of 5 months and it is one of the cause of jaundice"

The functional occlusal plane is also steep associated with a palatal plane that is tipped downward.\nIn long face individuals, who have excessive lower anterior face height, the palatal plane rotates down posteriorly, often creating a negative rather than the normal positive inclination to the true horizontal. The mandible shows an opposite, backward rotation, with an increase in the mandibular plane angle.\nRef: Orthodontics: Diagnosis and Management of Malocclusion and Dentofacial Deformities, 3e, Om P.

Here is an additional explanation: GYPSUM-BONDED INVESTMENTS\nThe \u03b1-hemihydrate form of gypsum is generally the binder for investments used in casting gold-containing alloys with melting ranges below 1000 \u00b0C. When this material is heated at temperatures sufficiently high to completely dehydrate the investment and to ensure complete castings, it shrinks considerably and occasionally fractures.\nA mixture of silica and calcinated gypsum powder (calcium sulfate hemihydrate, CaSO4\u2022 1/2 H2O) results in setting expansion greater than that of the gypsum product used alone. The silica particles probably interfere with the intermeshing and interlocking of the crystals as they form. Thus, the thrust of the crystals is outward during growth, and they increase expansion.\nThinner mix of a gypsum-bonded investment will decrease setting expansion."

So, males express the full syndrome, and females are carriers in whom manifestations of disease are typically limited to hematuria.\n\u2013\u2013 Autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant forms also exist in which both the sexes are equally susceptible.\n\u2013\u2013 In Alport syndrome, Hematuria is the earliest manifestation and the sensorineural deafness is the commonest extra renal abnormality."

PCRReverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (-PCR) It is a laboratory technique combining reverse transcription of RNA into DNA (in this context called complementary DNA or cDNA) and amplification of specific DNA targets using polymerase chain reaction (PCR).It is primarily used to measure the amount of a specific RNA. This is achieved by monitoring the amplification reaction using fluorescence, a technique called real-time PCR or quantitative PCR (qPCR). Combined -PCR and qPCR are routinely used for the analysis of gene expression and quantification of viral RNA in research and clinical settings.A method used to quantitate mRNA levels that rely upon the first step of cDNA copying of mRNAs catalyzed by reverse transcriptase before PCR amplification and quantitation. Sanger sequencing,Also known as the chain termination method, is a technique for DNA sequencing-based upon the selective incorporation of chain-terminating dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs) by DNA polymerase during in vitro DNA replication.Next-generation sequencing:Modified methods of genome sequencing.

Here is an additional explanation: Carbon is often added to the powder to produce clean castings and facilitate the divesting of the casting from the investment mold. This addition is appropriate when the casting alloy is gold, but there is disagreement regarding the effects of carbon in phosphate investments used for casting silver-palladium alloys, palladium-silver alloys, or base metal alloys. It is believed that carbon can embrittle the alloys, even though the investment is heated to temperatures that burn out the carbon. Some evidence indicates that palladium reacts with carbon at temperatures above 1504 \u00b0C. Thus, if the casting temperature of an alloy with high palladium content exceeds this critical point, a phosphate investment without carbon should be used.\nRef: Phillip\u2019s 12th edition page 208"

Serotonin and nor-adrenaline reuptake inhibition. Here is an additional explanation: Ans. A. Serotonin and nor-adrenaline reuptake inhibition* Tramadol differs from other traditional opioid medications in that it doesn't just act as a m-opioid agonist, but also affects monoamines by modulating the effects of neurotransmitters involved in the modulation of pain such as serotonin and norepinephrine which activate descending pain inhibitory pathways.* Tramadol's effects on serotonin and norepinephrine mimic the effects of other SNRI antidepressants such as duloxetine and venlafaxine.* Tramadol exists as a racemic mixture consisting of two pharmacologically active enantiomers that both contribute to its analgesic propey through different mechanisms and are also themselves metabolized into active metabolites: (+)-tramadol and its primary metabolite (+)-O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) are agonists of the m opioid receptor while (+)-tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake and (-)-tramadol inhibits norepinephrine reuptake.* These pathways are complementary and synergistic, improving tramadol's ability to modulate the perception of and response to pain."

Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Here is an additional explanation: - History given suggests the diagnosis of Juvunile myoclonic epilepsy Juvunile myoclonic epilepsy ( Janz Syndrome ) - Most common generalized epilepsy in young adults. - Stas in early adolescence with 1 or more of: Myoclonic jerks in morning, causing patient to drop things Generalized tonic-clonic seizures upon awakening Juvenile absences. - Sleep deprivation and photic stimulation can act as precipitants. - EEG shows generalized 4-5 Hz polyspike and slow wave discharge. OTHER OPTIONS: Atypical absence seizures - Less abrupt onset and offset of loss of awareness - Associated myoclonic components and tone changes of head and body - Precipitated by drowsiness - Accompanied by 1 to 2 hz spike and slow wave discharge. Benign childhood epilepsy syndrome with centrotemporal spikes - Rolandic epilepsy - Stas during childhood and is outgrown in adolescence. - Child wakes up at night owing to focal seizures causing buccal and throat tingling and tonic clonic contractions of 1 side of face, with drooling and inability to speak but with preserved consciousness and comprehension. - EEG shows typical broad based centrotemporal spikes that are markedly increased in frequency during drowsiness and sleep. - MRI is normal. - Patient respond well to carbamazepine."

Here is an additional explanation: 1. The reason for the development of allergy is the presence of plasma and the process of washing helps in the removal of residual plasma. if the Patient is having a history of allergy - Antihistaminic drugs -reduce the chances of development of allergic reactions during blood transfusion. 2. Irradiation - reduces the chance of development of Graft Versus Host Disease. Irradiation - causes - reduction in the number of the immunocompetent cells (lymphocytes mainly) Irradiation of cellular blood components (red blood cells, platelets, and granulocytes) is indicated to prevent the development of transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD). Patients at risk of TA-GVHD include immunocompromised patients who are receiving a bone marrow or stem cell transplant and fetuses undergoing an intrauterine transfusion. Irradiation is also indicated for recipients of components collected from a blood relative or HLA-matched donors. 3. Leukocyte reduction - Leukoreduction of whole blood and blood components has been shown to reduce recurrent febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions, reduce alloimmunization to leukocyte antigens that may complicate care of patients whoundergo transplantation or chronic transfusion therapy, and protect against transmission of cytomegalovirus (CMV) to patients at increased risk of CMV disease. antibodies in the recipient - react with donor leukocytes - release of cytokines - cause fever- known as Febrile Non-Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction. 4. Glycolisation - addition of glycol. useful in autologous blood transfusion - increases the life span of RBC. If the patient is having a history of development of anaphylaxis after blood transfusion, the patient is most likely to be suffering from IgA deficiency."

In negative feedback, the controller does the opposite, the change is negated or error is minimized. In positive feedback mechanism, controller does the same in direction of error & error is amplified. If the BP is increased, baroreceptor acts in a way as to decrease it or vice- versa. Increased pressure in blood vessels containing baroreceptor causes increased impulse firing. Baroreceptor signal enters the nucleus tractus solitarius, inhibit the vasoconstrictor center of the medulla, excite the vagal center. The net effects are inhibition of sympathetic activity, which causes vasodilation of veins & aerioles, decreased hea rate & strength of hea contraction. Baroreceptor maintain aerial pressure at a relatively constant level during changes in body posture and other daily activites."

Verapamil and Diltiazem: CCB (calcium channel blocker): These also inhibits SA Node and AV Node, hence depress the hea. So, when verapamil (or Diltiazem) is combined with metoprolol, they both depress hea and lead to bradycardia with AV block. Other CCBs include dihydropyridines (like amlodipine etc).

Here is an additional explanation: Dental plaque is the prerequisite for the development of smooth surface caries. The presence of extracellular polysaccharides (like glucans and levans) have been clearly demonstrated in dental plaque. Glucans, especially their water-insoluble fraction, can serve as a structural component of plaque matrix and help in adhering certain bacteria to the teeth. Even though the ability to produce acid may be a prerequisite for caries induction, but not all acid producing organism are cariogenic."

Here is an additional explanation: Normally, T4 and T3 exert negative feedback on TSH secretion by pituitary in two ways:\n\n\nBlock the secretion of TSH by pituitary directly --> major action\nBlock the secretion of TRH by hypothalamus (TRH stimulates the secretion of TSH by pituitary)\n\n\nIn primary hypothyrodism, T4 and T3 are not produced or produced in low concentration by thyroid. This results in abolition of negative feedback on TSH secretion. Thus, there is elevated TSH and pituitary can become hyperplastic to produce more TSH.\nIn pituitary cause of hypothyroidism (secondary hypothyroidism) both TSH and Thyroid hormone (T4, T3) are low as pituitary does not secrete TSH and TSH is the major stimulation for production of T4 and T3.\n\nAbout option d\n\nTSH resistance can also produce same picture i.e. raised TSH and low T4 with pituitary swelling.\nThere is thyroid insensitivity to TSH which results in hypothyroidism (1T4 and T3). Because of reduced thyroid hormone feedback, TSH is markedly elevated.\nHowever, Amongst the given options best option is primary hypothyrodism because TSH resistance is a very rare condition and further T4 levels are normal in Mild and moderate (Partial) TSH resistance."

Also estrogen has a positive feedback on LH and negative feedback on FSH which leads to increase in LH and decrease in FSH such that LH/FSH is > 2.1.\nNow the question arises whether this increase in LH is persistent. Most of the books do not state anything clearly except that there is an increase in the LH pulse amplitude and frequency.

Most intraoral machines use 60 to 70 kVp. The availability of constant-potential (fully rectified), high-frequency or direct current (DC)\u00a0dental X-ray units have made possible the production of radiographs with lower kilovoltage and at reduced levels of radiation. The surface exposure required to produce a comparable radiographic density using a constant-potential unit is approximately 25% less than that of a conventional self-rectified unit operating at the same kilovoltage. At the present time, several manufacturers produce DC units.\nThus, in intraoral radiograph, patient radiation is not decreased by decreasing kVp.\n\u00a0Reference: White and Pharoah's Oral Radiology Principles and Interpretation 7th edition page no 36"

Here is an additional explanation: Positional veigo/ BPPV: It is characterized by veigo when the head is placed in a ceain critical position. There is no hearing loss or other neurologic symptoms. Positional testing establishes the diagnosis and helps to differentiate it from positional veigo of central origin. Disease caused by a disorder of posterior semicircular canal though many patients have history of head trauma and ear infection. It has been demonstrated that otoconial debris, consisting of crystals and calcium carbonate, is released from the degeneration macula of the utricle and floats freely in the endolymph. When it settles on the cupula of posterior semicircular canal in a critical head position, it causes displacement of the cupula and veigo. The veigo is fatigable on assuming the same position repeatedly due to dispersal of the otoconia but can be induced again after a period of rest. Thus, typical history and Hallpike maneuver establishes the diagnosis. The condition can be treated by performing Epley's maneuver. The principle of this maneuver is to reposition the otoconial debris from the posterior semicircular canal back into the utricle. The doctor stands behind the patient and the assistant on the side. The patient is made to sit on the table so that when he is made to lie down, his head is beyond the edge of the table as is done in Dix-Hallpike maneuver. His face is turned 450 to the affected side. The maneuver consists of five positions * Position 1. With the head turned 450, the patient is made to lie down in head-hanging position (Dix-Hallpike). It will cause veigo and nystagmus. Wait till veigo and nystagmus subside. * Position 2. Head is now turned so that affected ear is facing up at a 900 rotation. * Position 3. The whole body and head are now rotated away from the affected ear to a lateral recumbent position in a 900 -rotation face-down position. * Position 4. Patient is now brought to a sitting position with head still turned to the unaffected side by 450. * Position 5. The head is now turned forward and chin brought down 200. There should be a pause at each position till there is no nystagmus or there is slowing of nystagmus, before changing to the next position. After maneuver is complete, patient should maintain an upright posture for 48 h. Eighty percent of the patients will be cured by a single maneuver. If the patients remain symptomatic, the maneuver can be repeated. A bone vibrator placed on the mastoid bone helps to loosen the debris. - Meniere's disease: Has an episodic veigo and it lasts for >20 minutes. - Vestibular neuronitis: Veigo lasts for many days. - Labyrinthitis: There is a history of fever and trauma, and the veigo lasts for days."

Here is an additional explanation: Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome and Delirium Tremens Alcohol withdrawal syndrome typically occurs within 1-2 days of alcohol abstinence and is characterized by autonomic hyperactivity, tremors, insomnia, nausea and vomiting, transient hallucinations, psychomotor agitation, anxiety, and tonic-clonic seizures. Symptoms may be mild for many patients, but if left untreated, it can lead to delirium tremens, an uncommon but severe and life-threatening manifestation of withdrawal marked by severe hallucinations, disorientation, and autonomic overactivity. Symptoms and signs include the following: Profoundly delirious state associated with tremulousness and agitation. Excessive motor activity (most notable as a tremor that affects the face, tongue, and extremities but that may also involve speech) and purposeless activity such as picking at the bedclothes. Hallucinations, classically visual rather than auditory, are a prominent feature. Autonomic nervous system hyperactivity: tachycardia, dilated pupils, fever, and hyperhidrosis. Loss of orientation as to time and place. Such patients are often oblivious to the most obvious features of the surrounding environment. Treatment Note temperature, pulse, and blood pressure, and record results twice hourly to monitor for hyperpyrexia and hypotension. Consider lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis if fever or meningismus is present. 1. FLUIDS Fluid requirements on the first day of treatment may be as if profound dehydration is present. Intravenous fluid should contain glucose to prevent hypoglycemia. 2. THIAMINE Thiamine, 100 mg/d, prevents Wernicke encephalopathy. 3.

But this principle should not be followed in the first trimester.\nSurgery in the first trimester is best avoided, as during surgery a corpus luteal cyst or ovary might be removed which will be detrimental to the pregnancy, which may end up in a miscarriage.\nTherefore, all such cases should be operated (ovariotomy/cystectomy) in the second trimester.\nTherefore, the best time of elective operation for an ovarian tumor in pregnancy is between 14 to 18 weeks, as the chances of abortion are less and access to the pedicle is easy."

Two-thirds of the first mandibular molars found in a Chinese population had this variation. Similarly, this distolingual root occurred in 4% of mandibular first molars of a Kuwaiti population. These results confirm the observation that East Asian populations have more three-rooted mandibular first molars than do other racial groups. Mandibular molars, mainly first molars, may also have an additional root located lingually or buccally. Although this is a rare occurrence in Caucasian populations, it is more common\u00a0in Asian populations. The radix entomolaris (RE) is a supernumerary root located distolingually\u00a0in\u00a0mandibular molars, whereas the radix paramolaris (RP) is an extra root located mesiobuccally. Each root usually contains a single root canal. The orifice of the RE is located distolingually to mesiolingually from the main canal or canals of the distal root; the orifice of the RP is located mesiobuccally to distobuccally from the main mesial root canals.\u00a0\nKey Concept:\nThe figure in the question show radix entomolaris."

Schwabach's test(Ref Dhingra 7/e p23, 5/e p25-27)Lateralization of Weber's test to right implies either right-sided conductive deafness or left sided sensorineural deafness.Now in conductive deafness bone conduction is better than air conduction in Rinnie's test, hence the patient probably has sensorineural deafness involving the left ear, as per the findings of Rinnie's and Weber tests.In such a case, Schwabach's test should be performed to see the absolute bone."

They are often formulated in several consistencies, including extra low, low, medium, heavy, and putty, in increasing order of filler content. Extra-low and putty forms are available only for condensation and addition silicones.\nPolysulfide is provided only in light-body and heavy-body consistencies. There is no heavy-body product for condensation silicone. Pigments are added to give each material a distinct color.\nThe base paste, is a polysulfide polymer that contains a multifunctional mercaptan (-SH) called a polysulfide polymer, a suitable\u00a0 filler\u00a0 (such as lithopone or titanium dioxide) to provide the required strength, a plasticizer (such as dibutyl phthalate) to confer the appropriate viscosity to the paste, and a small quantity of sulfur, approximately 0.5%, as an accelerator.\nReference: PHILLIPS\u2019 SCIENCE OF DENTAL MATERIALS, 12th ed page no 153"

Here is an additional explanation: Normal calcium level is 8.9-10.1 mg/dl (total calcium).\nSlightly less than half of the total serum calcium exists in free or ionized form. Remainder is bound to protein (mostly albumin). ionized calcium is relevant for cell fuction.\n\n\"There are few clinical situations in which the total calcium is not an adequate surrogate for the ionized Ca++ concentration. The most common and severe problem is the presence of hypoalbuminemia\".\n\nEach 1 gin/di of albumin in the serum binds about 0.8 mg/dl of calcium.\nA low total calcium concentration may be normal in a patient with significant hypoalbuminemia.\nNow, it is clear from above that a low level of serum protein lowers the total plasma calcium but not the ionized calcium, So, before treating hypocalcemia, measure the serum protein level."

Here is an additional explanation: Eisenmenger syndrome refers to patients with a VSD in which blood is shunted from right to left as a result of development of pulmonary vascular resistance. Initially shunt is from left to right as the systemic vascular pressure is greater than pulmonary vascular pressure. With time pulmonary vascular resistance increases due to change in pulmonary vessel wall as a result of increased flow in pulmonary vessels. When pulmonary vascular pressure exceeds the systemic vascular resistance, reversal of shunt into right to left shunt occurs.\nThis development of right to left shunt due to reversal of left to right shunt as a result of development of pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary hypertension is called Eisenmenger syndrome."

Drift is brought about by deposition on one side and resorption on the opposite side of the same cortical plate. The classical example of cortical drift is provided by growth of the facial surface of the maxilla."

Neonatal behavioral response grading \u2013 State 6. Here is an additional explanation: Neonatal behavioral assessment scale\n\nNeonatal Behavioural Assessment Scale (NBAS) is used to support parents in the neonatal unit, especially around discharge home. The aim is to increase parents' confidence in understanding their baby.\nAn infant's reaction are state related. So it is extremely important that observations of state be considered as a starting point from which all other observations are made.\nThe ideal time to administer the examination is when the infant is asleep and midway between feeding cycles.\n\nScores \nSleep states\n\nState 1 : Sleep with regular breathing, eyes closed, no spontaneous activity except startles or jerky movements at quite regular intervals.\n\na State 2 : Sleep with eyes closed; rapid eye movements can often be observed under closed lids; low activity level with random movements and startles.\nAwake states\n\nState 3 : Drowsy or semidrowsy; eyes may be open but dull and heavy lidded, or closed, eyelids fluttering; activity level minimal, Movements are usually smooth, although there may be startles. Some infants may also show fuss/cry vocalizations in this state. What distinguishes state 3 from state 5 when both are accompanied by fuss/cry vocalizations is the minimal movement in state 3 and considerable movement in state 5.\nState 4 : Alert, eyes open with bright look. Motor activity is minimal; there can be a glazed look that is easily changed into a brighter look with appropriate stimulation.\n\n\nState 5 : Eyes likely to be open; considerable motor activity, with thrusting movements of the extremities, and even a few spontaneous startles; reactive to external stimulation with increase in startles or motor activity.\n\n\nState 6 : Crying : characterized by intense, loud, rhythmic, and sustained cry vocalizations that are difficult to break through with stimulation; motor activity is high.\n\nComing to the question\n\nAccording to above staging, the newborn in our question comes under state 6 (crying lustily, and moving all 4 limbs).\nIf you have any confusion, read the following facts on crying (state 6) :-\n\n\"it is important to distinguish between crying as a state (stage 6) from the fuss/ay vocalization that can occur in state 5 and even state 3. Some infants show repeated episodes of fuss /cry vocalization in state 5 but may not reach state 6. This may also be a maturational issue, because some preterm infants may not have energy reserves to sustain state 6. In general, state 6 Can be distinguished from state 5 by the intensity and sustained quality of the crying (at least 15 seconds) and unavailability of infant in state 6. Repeated brief episodes of cry /fuss in state 5 do not mean that the infant has moved into state 6. Examiners need to give the infant the opportunity to show state 6\"\n\nSo, crying lustily with all limbs moving (child in question), straight away goes in state 6."

Here is an additional explanation: The surface of NiTi is rougher (because of surface defects, not the quality of polishing) than that of beta-Ti, which in turn is rougher than steel. However, there is little or no correlation for orthodontic wires between the coefficients of friction and surface roughness. (i.e., interlocking and plowing are not significant components of the total frictional resistance).\u00a0\nAlthough NiTi has greater surface roughness, beta-Ti has greater frictional resistance, it turns out that as the titanium content of an alloy increases, its surface reactivity increases, and the surface chemistry is a major influence on frictional behavior. Thus, beta-Ti, at 80% titanium, has a higher coefficient of friction than NiTi at 50% titanium, and there is greater frictional resistance to sliding with either than with steel.\nKey Concept\nAlthough NiTi has greater surface roughness, beta-Ti has greater frictional resistance.\nRef: Proffit 4th edition page 378"

It is not detectable in the serum during convalescent stage. The presence of HBsAg alone does not necessarily indicate the replication of complete virion, and the patients may not have symptoms of liver damage.\u00a0\n\nParija SC.

These strains are (1, 3, 5, 6, 18).\nThe M proteins molecules has a particular surface exposed antigenic domain against which Rheumatic fever patients mount a strong antibody response. These antibodies against the M proteins cross reacts with glycoproteins antigens in the heart, joints and other tissues because these glycoproteins share similar features with M antigenic domain."

SeleniumBlind staggers are no longer believed to be caused by selenium but by sulfate toxicity due to the consumption of high-sulfate alkali water and/or high sulfur-containing forages.Since Sulfate is not mentioned in Question we will go for selenium.Excess sulfate (>1% of diet) leads to polioencephalomalacia and the classical signs of blind staggers.Blind StaggersThis syndrome may occur within a brief period (a few days to a few weeks) after the animal has begun to take in very high dietary levels of selenium. The symptoms of this condition are: impaired vision, a depressed appetite, and wandering in circlesProlonged oral exposure of cattle to elevated dietary selenium (Se) is associated historically with 2 clinical syndromes:Alkali disease.\"Blind staggers\".These two syndromes are not necessarily independent of one another.

The hypothalamus contains two types of magnocellular (large) neurons that synthesize ADH in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, about five sixths in the supraoptic nuclei and about one sixth in the paraventricular nuclei. Both of these nuclei have axonal extensions to the posterior pituitary.\nThe\u00a0most\u00a0important\u00a0renal\u00a0action\u00a0of\u00a0ADH\u00a0is\u00a0to\u00a0increase\u00a0the\u00a0water permeability\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 distal\u00a0 tubule,\u00a0 collecting\u00a0 tubule,\u00a0and collecting\u00a0duct\u00a0epithelia. This effect helps the body to conserve water in circumstances such as dehydration. In the absence of ADH, the permeability of the distal tubules and collecting ducts to water is low, causing the kidneys to excrete large amounts of dilute urine, a condition called diabetes insipidus. Thus, the actions of ADH play a key role in controlling the degree of dilution or concentration of the urine."

The allantois is not functional in humans and degenerates to form the median umbilical ligament in the adult.\nAs the amnion expands, it pushes the vitelline duct, connecting stalk, and allantois together to form the primitive umbilical cord.\nThe definitive umbilical cord at term is pearl-white, 1\u20132 cm in\u00a0 diameter,\u00a0 50\u201360\u00a0 cm\u00a0 long,\u00a0eccentrically\u00a0 positioned,\u00a0 and contains the right and left umbilical arteries, left umbilical vein, and mucus connective tissue (Wharton\u2019s jelly).\nThe right and left umbilical arteries carry deoxygenated blood from the fetus to the placenta.

By the beginning of second trimester, it consists largely of extracellular fluid which diffuses through the fetal skin, and thus reflects the composition of fetal plasma\u201d.\nAfter 20 weeks, however, the cornification of fetal skin prevents this diffusion and amniotic fluid is composed largely of fetal urine.\u201d\nWilliams Obs. 23/e, p 88, 89\nReading the above text, it can be concluded that in early pregnancy - Mother is the main contributor whereas during rest of the pregnancy - Fetus is the main contributor."

Here is an additional explanation: Shoulder Dystocia:\nThe term shoulder dystocia is used to define a wide range of difficulties encountered in the delivery of the shoulders (A head to body delivery time exceeding 60 secs defines shoulder dystocia).\nRisk factors: Shoulder dystocia can occur in all those conditions where fetus is too big or in case of mismanaged labour.\nD-Maternal diabetes\nO-Maternal obesity and fetal obesity, i.e macrosomia\nP-Post-term pregnancy\nA-Anencephaly, Fetal ascites\nManagement of shoulder dystocia:\nShoulder dystocia should be managed as quickly as possible as interval of time from delivery of head to delivery of body is of great importance as far as survival of baby is concerned. Management follows a sequence of steps together called as Shoulder Dystocia Drill.\nFirst line measures:\n\nImmediately after recognition of shoulder dystocia extra help should be called, in the form of midwifery assistance, an obstetrician, a paediatric resuscitation team and an anaesthetist.\nMaternal pushing should be discouraged, as this may lead to further impaction of the shoulder, thereby exacerbating the situation.\nLiberal episiotomy should be given to provide more space posteriorly.\nFundal pressure should not be employed. As it is associated with an unacceptably high neonatal complication rate and may result in uterine rupture.\nModerate suprapubic pressure can be applied by the assistant.\nMcRoberts\u2019 manoeuvre is the single most effective intervention and should the first maneouvre to be performed. The\nMcRobert\u2019s manoeuvre is flexion and abduction of the maternal hips, positioning the maternal thighs on her abdomen.\n\nSecond line measures: They should be done only, if first line measures fail:\n\nWood\u2019s manoeuvre: It is progressively rotating the posterior shoulder by 180\u00b0. So that the impacted anterior shoulder is released.\n\nThird line measures\u2014They should be done only, if second line measures fail:\n\nCleidotomy: Fracturing the clavicle bone of the fetus\nSymphiostomy: Dividing the pubic symphysis of the mother\nZavanelli manoeuvre: Replacing the head of the baby back into the pelvis followed by cesarean section."

C: Nitrous oxideGeneral anaesthesia can be induced by intravenous (IV) injection, or breathing a volatile anaesthetic through a facemask (inhalational induction).Onset of anaesthesia is faster with IV injection than with inhalation, taking about 10-20 seconds to induce total unconsciousness.This has the advantage of avoiding the excitatory phase of anaesthesia, and thus reduces complications related to induction of anaesthesia.An inhalational induction may be chosen by the anesthesiologist where IV access is difficult to obtain, where difficulty maintaining the airway is anticipated, or due to patient preference (e.g. children).Commonly used IV induction agents include propofol, sodium thiopental, etomidate, and ketamine.The most commonly-used agent for inhalational induction is sevoflurane because it causes less irritation than other inhaled gasesIn order to prolong anaesthesia for the required duration (usually the duration of surgery), anaesthesia must be maintained. Usually this is achieved by allowing the patient to breathe a carefully controlled mixture of oxygen, nitrous oxide, and a volatile anaesthetic agent or by having a carefully controlled infusion of medication, usually propofol, through an IV.Induction Characteristics & Dosage Requirements for Currently AvailableSedative & Hypnotic DrugsDrug NameInduction Dose (mg/kg)Onset (sec)Duration (min)Thiopental3-6<305-10Methohexital1-3<305-10Propofol1.5-2.515-455-10Midazolam0.2-0,430-9010-30Diazepam0.3-0.645-9015-30Lorazepam0.03-0.0660-12060-120Etomidate0.2-0.33-123-12Ketamine1-210-2010-20"

The child rushes to dental clinic with avulsed tooth, the treatment is: Clean root surface with saline and reimplant. Here is an additional explanation: If the tooth has been out for 15 minutes to 60 minutes:\nTooth with closed apex\n\nClean the root surface with saline.\nDo not touch a viable root with hands, forceps, gauze or anything, or try to scrub or clean it to avoid injury to\nthe periodontal ligament which makes it difficult to revascularize the reimplanted tooth.\nExamine alveolar socket after cleaning it with saline. Do not overlook fracture of tooth and alveolar ridge.\nReimplant the tooth gently with firm finger pressure. Ask the patient to bite down firmly on a piece of gauze to help stabilize the tooth.\nAfter evaluating the occlusion, stabilize the tooth if required. Ideal splint required for an avulsed tooth is a flexible splint. The commonly used flexible splints are made of Gortex, metallic mesh stripes, synthetic clothes or orthodontic wire. A thick strip of composite bonded to the avulsed and the adjacent teeth also act as a splint.\n\nThe splint should engage several teeth around the avulsed tooth and it should be kept in place for not more than 7 to 10 days.\n\nContinue with the same treatment as above.\n\nTooth with open apex:\n\nClean the root surface with saline.\nExamine the alveolar socket after cleaning it with saline.\nCover the root surface with minocycline hydrochloride microspheres before reimplanting to kill bacteria which could enter the immature apex and form an abscess.\nContinue with the same treatment as above.\n\nRef: Textbook of endodontics, Nisha Garg and Amit Garg, 3rd edition, pg no:477"

However, even low-dose pills pose significant risk in women > 35 years of age, diabetics, hypertensives and in those who smoke. The excess risk is due to the estrogen component of the OC, and normalizes shortly after stopping the OC.\nRise in BP: Occurred in 5-10% women taking the earlier pills. The again is less frequent and smaller in magnitude with the low-dose pills of today. If the BP rises, best is to stop OCs: the BP normalizes in the next 3-6 months. Both the estrogen and progestin components are responsible for this effect, probably by increasing plasma angiotensinogen level and renin activity which have been found to be raised during OC use.

CLL is the cancer which is not associated with Radiation exposure. CLL patient blood sample contains large numbers of small round lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm.

DThe epidermis is composed of 4 or 5 layers, depending on the region of skin being considered.Those layers in descending order are:Cornified layer (stratum corneum)Composed of 10 to 30 layers of polyhedral, anucleated corneocytes (final step of keratinocyte differentiation), with the palms and soles having the most layers.Clear/translucent layer (stratum lucidum, only in palms and soles)This narrow layer is found only on the palms and soles. The epidermis of these two areas is known as \"thick skin\" because with this extra layer, the skin has 5 epidermal layers instead of 4Granular layer (stratum granulosum)Keratinocytes lose their nuclei and their cytoplasm appears granular. Lipids, contained into those keratinocytes within lamellar bodies, are released into the extracellular space through exocytosis to form a lipid barrier. Those polar lipids are then conveed into non-polar lipids and arranged parallel to the cell surface.Spinous layer (stratum spinosum)Keratinocytes become connected through desmosomes and sta produce lamellar bodies, from within the Golgi, enriched in polar lipids, glycosphingolipids, free sterols, phospholipids and catabolic enzymes.Langerhans cells, immunologically active cells, are located in the middle of this layer.Basal/germinal layer (stratum basale/germinativum).Composed mainly of proliferating and non-proliferating keratinocytes, attached to the basement membrane by hemidesmosomes.Melanocytes are present, connected to numerous keratinocytes in this and other strata through dendrites.Merkel cells are also found in the stratum basale with large numbers in touch-sensitive sites such as the fingeips and lips."

Fluoride release is slow and occurs throughout the life of the restoration.\u00a0Silicate cement was classed as a severe irritant to the pulp because of its low pH (acidic).\u00a0\nFor many years, silicate served as a standard for comparing the pulpal response to other materials.

Here is an additional explanation: Aim for the treatment of classical angina is decrease in work of hea. It can be accomplished by decrease in preload, decrease in afterload or decrease in hea rate. Nitrates act by production of nitric oxide (NO). NO stimulates guanylate cyclase in smooth muscles which leads to formation of cGMP. Later acts on smooth muscles to cause vasodilation. Nitrates mainly produce NO in veins leading to its predominant action as venodilation. Dilation of veins results in decrease in pre-load. Therefore major mechanism of action of nitrates in angina is decrease in preload. However, in variant angina these drugs benefit by causing coronary vasodilation as variant angina occurs due to vasospasm of coronary aery."

Here is an additional explanation: Resuscitation of neonate born through meconium-stained liquer (MSL) \n\nWhen baby passes meconium in utero, there is a chance that the mecomium will be aspirated into infant's mouth and potentially into the trachea and lungs.\nAppropriate steps must be taken immediately after delivery to reduce the risk of serious consequences resulting from aspiration of meconium.\nIntrapartum nasopharyngeal suctioning just after the delivery of head is no longer recommended as it does not reduce the risk of meconium aspiration syndrome and, on rare occasions, may cause nasophagngeal trauma or a cardiac arrhythmia.\n\nThe first step after delivery is to identify whether the newborn is vigrous or non-vigrous : -\nA) Vigrous newborn\n\nA newborn is classified as vigrous, if he has all the three signs are present : -\n\n\nStrong respiratory effort\nGood muscle tone\nHeart rate greater than 100\n\n\nThe vigrous child does not require any tracheal suctioning and the usual initial steps of resuscitation are provided, i.e., provide warniith, positioning, suctioning of mouth and nose (not tracheal suctioning); Dry, stimulate and 02 if necessary.\n\nB) Non-vigrous newborn\n\nIf any of the above three signs is present, the newborn is classified as non-vigrous.\nFor non-vigrous child, the initial steps are modified : -\n\n\nPlace the baby under radiant wanner and postpone suctioning to prevent stimulation of posterior pharyngeal wall that can cause bradycardia.\nResidual meconium in the mouth and posterior pharynx should be removed by suctioning under direct vision using a laryngoscope.\nThe trachea should then be intubated and mechonium suctioned from the lower airway. Tracheal suctioning is best done by applying suction directly to the endotracheal tube.\n\n\nAfter providing initial steps, the further management is same as with resucitation for other conditions."

Here is an additional explanation: Familial glucocorticoid deficiency :\n\nFamilial glucocorticoid deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive condition.\nIt is characterized by adrenal insufficiency.\nThe pathological examination of the adrenal gland reveals that :-\n\n\nZona glomerulosa\u00a0---> well preserved.\nZona fasciculata --->\u00a0atrophied.\nZona reticularis\u00a0\u00a0---> atrophied.\n\n\nThis causes low cortisol concentration because the zona fasciculata is primarily responsible for glucocorticoid production.\nBecause the zona glomerulosa is well preserved mineralocorticoid action is usually unaffected.\nLow circulating serum cortisol results in lack of feedback inhibition to the hypothalamus which results\u00a0in increased ACTH secretion from pituitary.\n\nClinical features :\n\nPatients with familial glucocorticoid deficiency generally presents with signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency with the important distinction that mineralocorticoid production is always normal.\nThe most common initial presenting sign is deep hyperpigmentation of the skin, mucous membrane or both as a result of the action of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) on cutaneous melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) receptors.\nThe symptoms are compatible with glucocorticoid deficiency. Many patients presents with recurrent hypoglycemia or severe infections.\nIn the neonatal period, frequent presenting signs include - feeding problems, failure to thrive, regurgitation and hypoglycemia manifesting as seizures."

Here is an additional explanation: Chemical fixation This utilizes organic or non-organic solutions to maintain adequate morphological preservation. Chemical fixatives can be considered as members of three major categories: coagulant, cross-linking, and compound. Coagulant fixatives: Both organic and non-organic solutions may coagulate proteins making them insoluble. Cellular architecture in vivo is maintained primarily by lipoproteins and fibrous proteins such as collagen. Coagulating these proteins maintains tissue histomorphology at the light microscope level. Unfounately, because coagulant fixatives result in cytoplasmic flocculation and poor preservation of mitochondria and secretory granules, these fixatives are not useful in ultrastructural analysis. Examples: Ethanol, methanol, acetone, picric acid and trichloroacetic acid Cross-linking fixatives: Several chemicals were selected as fixatives secondary to their potential actions of forming cross-links both within and between proteins and nucleic acids. Examples include formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde and other aldehydes, e.g. chloral hydrate and glyoxal, as well as metal salts, e.g. mercuric and zinc chloride, and other metallic compounds, e.g. osmium tetroxide. useful for electron microscopic examination - Glutraldehyde (best one)/formaldehyde/osmium tetraoxide Compound fixatives: Alcoholic formalin"

It is used to make cDNA, which is amplified. Thus RNA can be amplified by this method and quantification of mRNA can also be done (see fig). Here we use Tth polymerase enzyme which has both reverse transcriptase and polymerase activity WITH REGARD TO OTHER OPTIONS: Western blot is to detect protein. Next generation sequencing & Sanger's technique are for DNA sequencing. ADDITIONAL EDGE: Used to detect RNA expression Sample here is RNA. This RNA is conveed to cDNA by enzyme reverse transcriptase. Tth polymerase (Thermus thermophilus HB-8) has Polymerase as well as reverse transcriptase activity when mixed with manganese ions and can thus be used for the amplification of RNA to cDNA. This polymerase is thermostable but does not has proofreading activity. So it is usually combined with a proofreading enzyme."

Here is an additional explanation: In the posterior wall of the pharynx, the lower part of the thyropharyngeus is a single sheet of muscle, not overlapped internally by the upper and middle constrictors. This weak part lies below the level of the vocal folds or upper border of the cricoid\u00a0lamina and is limited inferiorly by the thick cricopharyngeal sphincter. This area is knows as Killian\u2019s dehiscence.\n\n\u00a0Pharyngeal diverticula are formed by outpouching of the dehiscence. Such diverticula are normal in the pig. Pharyngeal diverticula are often attributed to neuromuscular incoordination in this region which may be due to the fact that different nerves supply the two parts of the inferior constrictor.\n\u00a0The propulsive thyropharyngeus is supplied by the pharyngeal plexus, and sphincteric cricopharyngeus, by the recurrent laryngeal nerve. If the cricopharyngeus fails to relax when the thyropharyngeus contracts, the bolus of food is pushed backwards, and tends to produce a diverticulum."

The histopathology repo from his mitral valve is shown below. What is the likely diagnosis of these patients? Rheumatic hea disease. Here is an additional explanation: The above picture shows the presence of Aschoff bodies, which are pathognomic for Rheumatic Hea Disease. Rheumatic fever (RF) is an acute, immunologically mediated, multisystem inflammatory disease classically occurring a few weeks after an episode of group A streptococcal pharyngitis; occasionally, RF can follow streptococcal infections at other sites, such as the skin. Acute rheumatic carditis is a common manifestation of active RF and may progress over time to chronic rheumatic hea disease (RHD), mainly manifesting as valvular abnormalities. RHD is characterized principally by deforming fibrotic valvular disease, paicularly involving the mitral valve; indeed, RHD is viually the only cause of mitral stenosis Type of necrosis seen in RHD - Fibrinoid necrosis. Morphology: Distinctive lesions occur in the hea, called Aschoff bodies, consisting of foci of T lymphocytes, occasional plasma cells, and plump activated macrophages called Anitschkow cell (pathognomonic fo RF).These macrophages have abundant cytoplasm and central round-to-ovoid nuclei (occasionally binucleate) in which the chromatin condenses into a central, slender, wavy ribbon (hence the designation \"caterpillar cells\")."

It is seen in 30-50% of patients with pyelonephritis.\nIt is present in over 75% of patients with radiological evidence of chronic pyelonephritis Diagnosis of Vesicoureteric reflux -\nThe most useful process for conclusive diagnosis of reflux is micturating cystourethrogram.\nThis will demonstrate the grade of reflux as well as urethral anatomy.\nThe other useful technique for detecting vesicoureteric reflux is radionuclide imaging.\nIt is extremaly sensitive at detecting reflux but do not demonstrate the anatomic detail seen with voiding cystourethro gram.\nSo they are used for follow up after micturating cystourethrogram because they offer less radiation exposure."

Here is an additional explanation: The viscosity of many dental materials decreases with increasing strain rate until it reaches a nearly constant value. That is, the faster they are stirred, forced through a syringe, or squeezed, the less viscous and more fluid they become. This is pseudoplastic viscosity and is illustrated by the change in slope of the plot in the figure.\nThe viscosity of a pseudoplastic fluid decreases with increasing shear rate.\u00a0\nThe tomato-based food condiment ketchup is also pseudoplastic, which makes it difficult to remove from a bottle. Shaking the bottle or rapping the side of the bottle increases its shear rate, decreases its viscosity, and improves its pourability.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA Bingham plastic is a viscoplastic material that behaves as a rigid body at low stresses but flows as a viscous fluid at high stress. It is named after Eugene C. Bingham who proposed its mathematical form."

Its formation in liver is dependant on fat soluble vitamin K. Absorption of vitamin K occurs with bile acid. In cholestasis absorption of bile acid (vitamin K) is not affected, rather there is accumulation of bile acids, so levels of vitamin K and clotting factors dependant on vitamin K are also normal. The prothrombin time therefore, remains normal in cholestasis.\nOnly when ursodeoxycholic acid or cholestyramine are being given to patients of cholestasis. Prothrombin time needs to be monitored because these drugs decrease the absorption of bile acids and can therefore cause prolongation of prothrombin time."

At first beta blockers should be staed at low dose, dose should be increased gradually so that predominant action is on kidneys not on hea. Beta blockers used are - Carvedilol, metoprolol and bisoprolol. Sacubitril - It is NEP(neutral endopeptidase) inhibitor, which is required for metabolism of BNP(brain natriuretic peptide) as a result BNP levels are increased resulting in natriuresis and vasodilation. Thus can be used in CHF. Nesiritide- It is recombinant BNP. It is given through subcutaneous route. Trimetazidine -it is a metabolic modulator. it paially inhibits beta oxidation of fatty acids which results in shifting of metabolism of hea muscles from fatty acids to glucose Which require less amount of oxygen so beneficial for the patient of angina pectoris but not used in hea failure."

D: CoisoneFetal adrenals shows hyperophy of the reticular zone (fetal zone), which is the site of synthesis of oestriol precursor, coisol and dehydroepiandrosterone.After 12 weeks of gestation, the activity of 3 p-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD3B) decreases in fetal adrenal and sulfokinase activity increases.At that time (during the mid-gestation, 12 to 22 weeks) the major steroid products are DHEA and DHEA Sulfate (DHEA-S).During the mid-gestation (12 to 22 weeks), the aromatase activity and sulfokinase activity increases. So Placenta itself utilizes fetal DHEA and DHEA-S as substrate for estrone and estradiol as precursors."

The cast-metal onlay is often an excellent alternative to a crown for teeth that have been greatly weakened by caries or by large, failing restorations but where the facial and lingual tooth surfaces are relatively unaffected by disease or injury. For such weakened teeth, the superior physical properties of a casting alloy are desirable to withstand the occlusal loads placed on the restoration; also the onlay can be designed to distribute occlusal loads over the tooth in a manner that decreases the chance of tooth fracture in the future.\nSturdevant operative dentistry\u00a07th\u00a0Edition, Page No:e94"

Here is an additional explanation: Answer- A. Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's lymphomaThis tumor contains so-called L&H (lymphocytic and histiocytic) variants, which have a multilobed nucleus resembling a popcorn kernel (\"popcorn cell\"). Eosinophils and plasma cells are usually scant or absent. In contrast to the Reed-Sternberg cells found in classical forms of HL, L&E variants express B-cell markers typical of germinal-cenler B cells, sach as CD20 and BCL6, and are usually negative for CD15 and CD30.Histological diagnosis is established by presence of Reed-Sterntrerg cells along with background of mixed inflammation consisting of neutrophils, plasma cells, eosinophils & histiocytes.Reed-Sternberg cells are large and are either multinucleated or have a bilobed nucleus (thus resembling an \"owl's eye\" appearance) with prominent eosinophilic inclusion-like nucleoli.Reed-Sternberg cells are CD30 & CD15 positive, usually negative for CD20 & CD45.Nodular sclerosisMC subtype; usually stage I or ll disease frequent mediastinal involvementMore common in females, most patients young adults"

        "generated_explanation": "All are true about aneuploidy except: Occurrence of aneuploidy has no relation with the progression of mother's age. Here is an additional explanation: Aneuploidy\n\nEach human cell consists of 23 pair of chromosomes i.e., the normal chromosome number is 46\nAneuploidy is a deviation from the normal number of 46 chromosome. Which could be be 47 or 45 chromosomes or it can be defined as state of having chromosome number that is not multiple of 23.\n\nNondisjunction\n\nNondisjunction is failure of paired homologus chromosomes to separate during the first meiotic division that leads to the production of gametes (ova and spermatozoa).\nThus, some gametes receive two and other receive none of the involved pair. After the second meiotic division the resulting gametes will have 24 and 22 chromosomes respectively. Such gametes are aneuploid.\n\nAnaphase lag\n\nIn anaphase lag, one homologus chromosome in meiosis or one chromatid in mitosis lags behind and is left out of the cell nucleus. This results in one normal cell and one cell with monosomy.\n\nSurvival of Aneuploidy\n\nMonosomy or trisomy involving the sex chromosome are compatible with life and are usually associated with variable degree of phenotypic abnormalities.\nMonosomy involving an autosome generally represents loss of too much genetic information to permit live births or\u00a0 even embryogenesis.\nWith the exception of trisomy 21 all others will produce severely handicapped infants who almost invariably die at an early age.\n\nEstimated abortion rate in early pregnancy"

Its surface may have a smooth, lobulated, or, occasionally, warty appearance that is erythematous and often ulcerated. Depending on the age of the lesion, the texture varies from soft to firm and is suggestive of an ulcerated fibroma.\u00a0\nBecause of the pronounced vascularity of these lesions, they often bleed easily when probed.\nHistologically, the pyogenic granuloma presents as a remarkable proliferation of plump fibroblasts and endothelial cells with the formation of prominent numbers of\u00a0 thin-walled, endothelium-lined vascular channels. A polymorphous inflammatory cell infiltrate is present, and the overlying surface epithelium is often ulcerated. Treatment consists of surgical excision, with care being taken to completely remove any local irritant that may still be present that would predispose to recurrence of the lesion.\nReference: McDONALD AND AVERY\u2019S DENTISTRY for the CHILD and ADOLESCENT, 10th ed page no 604,605"

Here is an additional explanation: EDTA- it is an anticoagulant that is preferred when we want to look at the morphology or we want to do any of the blood counts. Sodium fluoride - it inhibits enolase enzyme thus inhibits glycolysis process , so it is used for glucose estimation . Citrate - 3.2%Trisodium citrate - it is used for the determining the value of ESR and is also used for doing any kind of coagulation study. All the three (sodium EDTA, sodium fluoride, trisodium citrate) above use sodium. therefore, if we use any of these chemicals for the purpose of Serum Electrolyte measurement, the value of sodium and other electrolytes are going to be altered. So WHO recommends that for the purpose of Serum Electrolyte measurement we use an anticoagulant Lithium Heparin. It doesn't cause any alterations in the serum electrolytes."

The lateral view is useful in detecting spondylolisthesis; it may demonstrate the pars defect.Spondylolisthesis is forward slip of one veebrae upon another; so it is best viewed (or seen earliest) in sagittal images of spine i.e. lateral and oblique X-ray of spine and saggital and axial views of CT and MRIQ"
