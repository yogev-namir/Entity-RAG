,"['blood flow', 'fluid accumulation']","GFR is increased by all except? Renal stone in ureter. Here is an additional explanation: Increased blood flow to glomerular capillaries causes increased capillary hydrostatic pressure causing increased GFR. The efferent aeriole constriction also causes increased capillary hydrostatic pressure causing increased GFR. Plasma colloid oncotic pressure is the force that opposes the filtration; when it is decreased, GFR increased. In case of nephrolithiasis or renal stone, there will be decreased flow of tubular fluid which causes fluid accumulation in Bowman's capsule leading to increased hydrostatic pressure in Bowman's capsule which opposes filtration causing decreased GFR Net filtration pressure = PG -PB - pG PG: glomerular hydrostatic pressure PB: hydrostatic pressure in Bowman's capsule PG: Colloid osmotic pressure of glomerular capillary plasma proteins GFR = KFX net filtration pressure KF = capillary filtration coefficient",139,"['glomerular capillaries', 'efferent aeriole constriction', 'tubular fluid', 'ureter', 'bowman']","['renal stone', 'nephrolithiasis']",,

Secondary alveolar bone grafting (SABG) is done at an age when the growth inhibition effects of the surgery on maxilla are minimised, and it can help the maxillary canine or lateral incisor to erupt normally through the cancellous bone. After the age of 9 years, maxillary growth is minimal. Secondary bone grafting is done during the mixed dentition stage after the eruption of permanent incisors, but before the eruption of permanent canines. The timing of bone graft is based on the root formation and eruption pattern of the maxillary lateral incisor and maxillary canine. In case, insufficient bone is available in the cleft area for the lateral incisors to erupt, bone graft can be done around 7 years of age.
Note: In this patient, since the transverse width is normal, there is no need for expansion.

,['groove'],"Not a part of ethmoid bone is Inferior turbinate. Here is an additional explanation: The ethmoid bone is cuboidal in overall shape and contains the ethmoidal cells (ethmoidal sinuses). It is composed of

Two rectangular box-shaped ethmoidal labyrinths, one on each side.
They are united superiorly across the midline by a perforated sheet of bone - the cribriform plate. 
The perpendicular plate - A second sheet of bone descends vertically in the median sagittal plane from the cribriform plate to form part of the nasal septum.

Ethmoidal labyrinth:
Each ethmoidal labyrinth is composed of two delicate sheets of bone, which sandwich between them the ethmoidal cells.
■ The lateral sheet of bone (the orbital plate) is flat and forms part of the medial wall of the orbit.
■ The medial sheet of bone forms the upper part of the lateral wall of the nasal cavity and is characterized by two processes and a swelling—

The two processes are curved shelves of bone (the superior and middle conchae), which project across the nasal cavity and curve downward ending in free medial margins, while inferior to the origin of the middle concha, the middle ethmoidal cells form a prominent bulge (the ethmoidal bulla), on the medial wall of the labyrinth.
Agger nasi - runs forward and downwards from upper end of anterior border of middle concha.

TO NOTE: Inferior concha/ inferior nasal turbinate is an independant bone, not a projection of ethmoidal labyrinth.
Ethmoidal infundibulum:- Extending anterosuperiorly from just under the bulla is a groove (the ethmoidal infundibulum), which continues upward, and narrows to form a channel that penetrates the ethmoidal labyrinth and opens into the frontal sinus. This channel is for the frontonasal duct, which drains the frontal sinus.
Uncinate process:- A delicate irregularly shaped projection (the uncinate process) on the anterior aspect of the inferior surface of the ethmoidal labyrinth.
Cribriform plate:

The cribriform plate is at the apex of the nasal cavities and fills the ethmoidal notch in the frontal bone and separates the nasal cavities below from the cranial cavity above.
Small perforations in the bone allow the fibers of the olfactory nerve  to pass between the two regions.
A large triangular process (the crista galli) at the midline on the superior surface of the cribriform plate anchors a fold (falx cerebri) of dura mater in the cranial cavity.

What test would you recommend for the mother so that she can know about her chances of getting a Down's syndrome baby is this present pregnancy. How will you assure the mother about the chances of Down's syndrome in the present pregnancy? Chorionic villus sampling. Here is an additional explanation: Friends – In Patients with previous H/O Down’s syndrome the only confirmatory test, which tells us with 100% reliability of the chances of Down’s syndrome in present pregnancy is “Karyotyping”.
The sample for karyotyping can be obtained in first-trimester by – chorionic villi sampling and in 2nd trimester by amniocentesis.
So obviously we will think of marking option ‘c’ i.e. chorionic villi sampling as the correct answer but, The Question specifically mentions that patient is 9 weeks pregnant and we all know that if CVS is done before 10 weeks– it can lead to limb reduction defects and oromandibular defects in the fetus \Some people argue CVS is not the correct thing to do at this stage.
Read for yourself what Williams has to say on this issue.
“Early reports of an association between CVS and limb. Reduction defects and oromandibular limb hypogenesis caused a great deal of concern (Burton, 1992; Firth, 1991, 1994; Hsieh, 1995, and all their colleagues). Subsequently, it was shown that limb-reduction defects were associated with CVS performed earlier in gestation—typically around 7 weeks”

In response to hypoxia, anemia, or hemorrhage, the synthesis of hepcidin is reduced, leading to increased synthesis of ferropoin and increased iron absorption.

The extraction of a tooth entails removal of the contact point and half the interproximal embrasure; as a consequence, the papilla is not compressed but flattens out, and esthetics  are  compromised.  
The papilla can be maintained if at the time of extraction an ovate  pontic  is created  that  will provide the contact point and lateral embrasure support  that the papilla needs. 
An ovat  pontic is inserted 2.5 mm into the extraction site. The size and shape of the ovate pontic should be the same as the tooth that was extracted.  
A site preservation bone grafting procedure should be performed at the time of the extraction. If the bone levels remain stable, the papilla will also be stable. 

Key Concept
Ovate pontics are used in cases where the residual ridge is defective or incompletely healed.

Usually an alginate impression does not adhere to the oral tissues as well as some of the elastomers do, so it is easier to remove the alginate impression rapidly.

,"['tear', 'acl', 'fail']","Positive pivot shift test in knee is because of injury to - Anterior cruciate ligament. Here is an additional explanation: COLLATERAL LIGAMENT INJURY

The most common mechanism of ligament disruption of knee is abduction (valgus), flexion and internal rotation of femur on tibia which usually occur in sports in which the foot is planted solidly on the ground and leg is twisted by rotating body.
The medial structures medial (tibial) collateral ligament (MCL) and medial capsular ligament are first to fail, followed by ACL tear, if the force is of sufficient magnitude. The medial meniscus may be trapped between condyles and have a peripheral tear, thus producing unhappy triad of 0’ Donoghue.
Main test for MCL (medial collateral ligament) is valgus (abduction) stress in 30° of knee flexion. (Because in full extension it is indicative of combined MCL, posterior oblique ligament injury and posterior cruciate ligament injury).
Varus (Adduction) stress test in 30° flexion (removes the lateral stabilizing effect of iliotibial band so that the lateral collateral ligament can exclusively be examined).

Negative immune regulationNobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine jointly, has been awarded to James P. Allison/Tasuku Honjo for their discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation.James P. Allison studied a known protein that functions as a brake on the immune system. He realized the potential of releasing the brake and thereby unleashing our immune cells to attack tumors.Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-associated Antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoints are negative regulators of T-cell immune function. Inhibition of these targets, resulting in increased activation of the immune system, has led to new immunotherapies for melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and other cancers.For several types of cancer, including lung cancer, renal cancer, lymphoma and melanoma checkpoint therapy against PD-1 has proven more effective and positive results found.But recent clinical studies indicate that for melanoma the combination therapy of both CTLA-4 and PD-1 is more effective.Thus, Allison and Honjo combine different strategies to release the brakes on the immune system with the aim of eliminating tumor cells even more efficiently.Their paper formed the basis of current cancer immunotherapy.But the original concept of cancer immunotherapy was discovered by William Bradley Coley (1872).",484,"['melanoma', 'renal cancer']",,,

Adhesive failure of metal ceramic bond. Here is an additional explanation: A thermal contraction mismatch that results from a higher coeﬃcient of contraction of porcelain (αP is greater than αM) will introduce residual tangential and hoop tensile stresses. The additive eﬀect of tangential tensile stress induced in the porcelain by the intraoral force can exceed the tensile strength of the porcelain and causes crack propagation in the porcelain veneer. When the contraction coeﬃcient of the porcelain is much lower than that of the metal (αP much lower than αM), porcelain cracking or metal-ceramic bond failure can occur near the metal-porcelain interface. This incompatibility failure is likely caused by the development of radial tensile stresses that exceed the tensile strength of porcelain.

The only exit for systemic venous blood coming to the right atrium is by way ofAtrial Septal defect. Through this the blood goes to left atrium from where it enters left ventricle.
A ventricular septal defect provides communication between the left ventricle and the outflow portion of the right ventricle. The left ventricle therefore maintain both the systemic as well as the pulmonary circulation thus there is hypertrophy of the left ventricle which is reflected by left axis deviation in ECG.
The pulmonary blood flow is dependent on the size of the ventricular defect, the smaller the VSD, the lesser the pulmonary blood flow. 90% patients of Triscuspid Atresia have diminished pulmonary blood flow.

,,"NESTROFT test is a screening test for – β–thalassemia. Here is an additional explanation: NESTROFT ( Naked Eye Single Tube Red Cell Osmotic Fragility Test) is a screening test for detection of beta thalassemia trait.

Thalassemia screening

Widespead prevlence of thalessemia has led to a pressing demand for community, screening.
Various methods for screening of thalassemia trait are available which include peripheral smear examination, RBC indices, 1VIeintzer's fraction, discriminant functions, NESTROFT etc.
NESTROFT TEST is used in many centres in India for screening of thalassemia trait.
If mother is NESTROFT positive, the confirmatory test for HbA2 is done for mother and the father is subjected to screening by NESTROFT. If father is also NESTROFT positive, confirmatory test for HbA2 is done for father.
If both the parents have thalessemia trait, there is 1:4 chance of fetus having thalassemia major.
Therefore, prenatal diagnosis is done by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) in first trimester.
If CVS confirms the fetus to be having thalasemia major, termination of pregnancy is indicated after counseling the parents.
If the fetus has thalassemia minor (trait) pregnancy is continued as such and baby will have normal lifespan.
It is worth noting here that a positive NESTROFT test is seen in other conditions beside beta thalassemia trait. These are iron deficiency anemia, alpha thalassemia trait, homozygous and heterozygous HbE, HbS as well as hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin.

Therefore, a positive NESTROFT test should always be followed by a confirmatory test for HBA2 ( eg. serum electrophoresis).",605,"['father', 'mother']","['alpha thalassemia', 'thalassemia major', 'thalessemia trait', 'iron deficiency anemia', 'β–thalassemia', 'thalassemia', 'beta thalassemia trait', 'thalassemia minor', 'hbe', 'thalasemia major', 'hbs']",,

,,"Anchorage not being applied here: Stationary. Here is an additional explanation: Different types of anchorage
Intraoral Anchorage

Anchorage units are present within the oral cavity.
Anchorage sources can be teeth, palate, etc.

Simple Anchorage

When application of force tends to change the axial inclination of the tooth or teeth that form the anchorage unit in the plane of space in which the force is being applied.

Stationary anchorage

Anchor tooth or source does not move against the forces of teeth.
In real sense, only the extra-oral source of anchorage like can be from headgears would be anchorage.
Anchor tooth being housed in a bioactive environment would show some degree of movement and hence cannot be classified as stationary anchorage in a real sense.

Reciprocal Anchorage:

Teeth which are pulled against each other to close spaces.
Midline diastema in the upper arch with elastic arch.
Cross elastics to correct molar cross-bite.
Arch expansion using a midline screw.
The molar rotator.

 Single or Primary Anchorage

The tooth to be moved against a tooth which can have greater alveolar support area.
Like a molar along with adjacent premolars used to align another molar.

Compound Anchorage

The use of more teeth with greater anchorage potential to move a tooth or group of teeth with lesser support.
Like in the fixed orthodontic appliances retracting incisors using loop mechanics.

Reinforced Anchorage

Reinforcing of anchorage units by use of more than one type of resistance units.
Like headgears along with routine fixed mechano-therapy or (extra-oral anchorage and intra arch compound anchorage)

Key Concept: 
Since the figure shows the movement of both the units towards each other, this doesn’t fit the definition of stationary anchorage.",612,['upper arch'],,,

He was discharged 2 days back healthy. What could be the probable diagnosis – Hypoplastic left heart syndrome. Here is an additional explanation: livpolastic left heart syndrome 

Hypoplastic left heart syndrome occurs when parts of the left side of the heart (mitral valve, left ventricle, aortic valve, and aorta) do not develop completely. The condition is present at birth (congenital).
Hypoplastic left heart is a rare type of congenital heart disease. It is more common in males than in females. As with most congenital heart defects, there is no known cause. About 10 % of patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome also have other birth defects.
The problem develops before birth when the left ventricle and other structures do not grow properly, including the:

(i) Aorta-the blood vessel that carries oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle to the entire body
Entrace and exit of the ventricle
Mitral and aortic valves

This causes the left ventricle and aorta to be poorly developed, or hypoplastic. In most cases, the left ventricle and aorta are much smaller than normal.
In patients with this condition, the left side of the heart is unable to send enough blood to the body. As a result, the right side of the heart must maintain the circulation for both the lungs and the body. The right ventricle can support the circulation to both the lungs and the body for awhile, but this extra workoad eventually causes the right side of the heart to fail.
The only possibility of survival is a connection between the right and left side of the heart, or between the systemic

arteries and pumonary arteries (the blood vessels that carry blodd to the lungs). Babies are normally born with two
of these connections:
(i) Foramen ovale (a hole between the right and left atrium)
Ductus arteriosus (a small vessel that connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery)

Both of these connections normally close on their own a few days after birth.
In babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, blood from the right side of the heart travels through the ductus arteriosus. This is the only way for blood to get to the body. if the ductus arteriosus is allowed to close in a baby with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the patient may quickly die because no blood will be pumped to the body.
Babies with known hypoplatic left heart syndrome are usually started on a medicine to keep the ductus arteriosusopen.
Because there is little or no flow out of the left heart, blood reaming to the heart from the lungs needs to pass through the foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect (a hole connecting the collecting chambers on the left and right sides of the heart) back to the right side of the heart. If there is no foramen ovale, or if it is too small, the baby could die. Patients with this problem have the hole between their atria opened, either with surgery or using a thin, flexible tube (heart catheterization).

Symptoms

At first, a newborn with hypoplastic left heart may apper normal. Symptoms usually occur in the first few hours of life, although it may take up to a few days to develop symptoms. These symptoms may include:


Bluish (cyanosis) or poor skin color
Cold hands and feed (extremities)


Lethargy


Poor pulse
Poor suckling and feeding
Pounding heart
Rapid breathing
Shortness of breath.
Since the systemic circulation is dependent on the patent ductus arteriosus the closure of ductus arterious leads to shock.
Signs of heart failure usually appears within the first few days or weeks of life and include dyspnoea, hepatomegaly and low cardiac output. When PDA closes suddenly shock occurs all the peripheral pulses may be weak or absent.

Ventricular septal defect

These patients with VSD's become symptomatic around 6-10 weeks of age.
They usually present with congestive cardiac failure.

Ebstein's anomaly 

Ebstein's anomaly consists of downward displacement of an abnormal tricuspid value into the right ventricle.
These patients usually present in teenage/adolescent years.
They may also present in infancy but they usually do not present with shock or severe hypoperfusion.

Aorticopulmonary window defect

An Aorticopulmanry window defect consists of a communication between the ascending Aorta and the main pulmonary artery.

Sudden post partum collapse – may be seen in all the four cases viz – amniotic fluid embolism, PPH, uterine inversion and eclampsia.
But in case of PPH antecedent H/O excessive blood loss, in eclampsia – H/O antecedent convulsions and in amniotic fluid embolism – H/O abrupt onset of respiratory distress before collapse should be present, which is not given in the question so these options are being excluded.
The clinical picture of acute inversion occurring in the third stage of labour is characterised by shock and haemorrhage, the shock being out of proportion to the bleeding.
Since this a problem which occurs due to mismanaged third stage of labour, patient doesnot have any complain in the antenatal period or during labour.

Here is an additional explanation: When the facial growth pattern is viewed against the perspective of the cephalocaudal gradient, it is not surprising that the mandible, being farther away from the brain, tends to grow more and later than the maxilla, which is closer.
Growth of the mandible continues at a relatively steady rate before puberty. Ramus height increases 1 to 2 mm per year and body length increases 2 to 3 mm per year. These cross-sectional data tend to smooth out the juvenile and pubertal growth spurts, which do occur in growth of the mandible.
Growth in length and height of both jaws continues through the period of puberty.
Since the age of the child is less than 6 years and growth spurts are yet to occur. So at this point of time, in this patient, the best treatment protocol will be wait and watch.

Here is an additional explanation: ""Respiratory distress in an infant along with a positive family history of similarly affected newborn infants strongly suggests, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis"".
Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis 

Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a disorder characterized by the intraalveolar accumulation of pulmonary surfactant.
Two clinically distinct forms of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis are seen -


Fatal form                                -->          Presenting shortly after birth (congenital PAP)

u Gradually progressive form -->           Presenting in older infants and children
Pathology

Although the mechanisms that lead to alveolar proteinosis are undefined, histological findings suggests that they result in a disruption of pulmonary surfactant metabolism.
The main surface tension lowering agent in surfactant is phospholipids le. primary dipalmitol phosphatidyl choline.
However DPCC needs surfactant protein (in endogenous and natural surfactants) for efficient dispersion which enables the formation of a phospholipid monolayer on the alveolar surface.
There are two surfactant proteins present in the body i.e., protein A and protein B.
In pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, there is absence of protein B.
In the absence of protein B, the rapid spread and absorption of the phospholipid (DPCC) does not take place so they cannot form a phospholipid monolayer on the alveolar surface.
This in turn leads to failure of expansion of alveoli leading to poor cardiorespiratory adaptation at birth.

Clinical manifestation -

This disorder is immediately apparent in the newborn period and rapidly leads to respiratory failure.
Congenital pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is clinically and radiographically indistinguishable from more common disorders of the newborn that lead to respiratory failure including pneumonia, generalized bacterial infection, respiratory distress syndrome and total anomalous pulmonary venous return with obstruction.

Diagnosis

Histopathological examination of lung biopsy specimen is the gold standard for diagnosis.
On histopathological examination distal air spaces are filled with a granular, eosinophillic material that stains

positively with periodic - acid schiff reagent and is diastase resistant.
Treatment

Untreated, alveolar proteinosis in newborns is rapidly fatal and no successful medical therapy has been developed.
Repeated bronchoalveolar lavage is a temporizing measure.
Lung transplantation is the only therapeutic option but its use is limited by concerns about disease recurrence.",827,"['lung', 'distal air spaces']","['alveolar proteinosis', 'respiratory distress', 'respiratory distress syndrome', 'respiratory failure', 'bacterial infection', 'obstruction', 'neonatal', 'pneumonia', 'pulmonary alveolar proteinosis']",,"['male', 'baby']"

What is the mechanism of action of coicosteroids in this condition? They increase bronchial responsiveness to salbutamol. Here is an additional explanation: Ans. b. They increase bronchial responsiveness to salbutamol Coicosteroids has a dual effect in acute asthma with an early facilitator effect on airway beta-2 adrenoreceptor sensitivity and a later effect on airway inflammation, which fuher emphasizes the need fir coicosteroids to he administered as early as possible during an acute asthma attack.""he molecular mechanism of action of coicosteroids involves several effects on the inflammatory process. The major effect of coicosteroids is to switch off the transcription of multiple activated genes that encode inflammatory proteins such as cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and inflammatory enzymes. This effect involves several mechanisms, including inhibition of the transcription factor NF-KB, but an impoant mechanism is recruitment of HDAC2 to the inflammatory gene complex, which reverses the histone acetylation associated with increased gene transcription. Coicosteroids also activate anti-inflammatory genes, such as mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatase-1, and increase the expression of IQ-receptors.

reastfeeding jaundice and Breastmilk jaundice 

There is strong association between exclusive breastfeeding and neonatal jaundice.
A few babies who remain on exclusive breast feed develop jaundice in the second week of life and continue well into the third month. This is called breastmilk jaundice.
A bilirubin level of over 20 mg/dl may be attained. (It is presumed to be due to inhibitory substances in the breastmilk that interfere with bilirubin conjugation e.g. pregananediol and free fatty acids).
Temporary interruption of breastmilk feeds will dramatically reduce the serum levels of bilirubin and there may be slight increase in bilirubin when breast feeding is resumed, but it never reaches the previous levels. Hypothyroidism  
Persistent elevation of indirect bilirubin is the first sign of congenital hypothyroidism in neonates.
This is due to decreased activity of UDPGT for weeks or months after birth.
At least 10% of all infants with congenital hypothyroidism will have jaundice as the presenting symptom.
Treatment with thyroxine promptly alleviates jaundice.

Psoas abscesses may arise from a hematogenous source, by contiguous spread from an intra- abdominal or pelvic process, or by contiguous spread from nearby bony structures (e.g., veebral bodies). Associated osteomyelitis due to spread from bone to muscle or from muscle to bone is common in psoas abscesses. When pott's disease was common, Mycobacterium tuberculosis was a frequent cause of psoas abscess. Currently, either S. aureus or a mixture of enteric organisms including aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli is usually isolated from psoas abscesses in the United States. S. aureus is most likely to be isolated when a psoas abscess arises from hematogenous spread or a contiguous focus of osteomyelitis; a mixed enteric flora is the most likely etiology when the abscess has an intra- abdominal or pelvic source. Patients with psoas abscesses frequently present with fever, lower abdominal or back pain, or pain referred to the hip or knee. CT is the most useful diagnostic technique.""- Harrison 19/e p852 ""Spinal TB (Pott's disease or tuberculous spondylitis) often involves two or more adjacent veebral bodies. Whereas the upper thoracic spine is the most common site of spinal TB in children, the lower thoracic and upper lumbar veebrae are usually affected in adults. From the anterior superior or inferior angle of the veebral body, the lesion slowly reaches the adjacent body, later affecting the interveebral disk. With advanced disease, collapse of veebral bodies results in kyphosis (gibbus). A paraveebral ""cold"" abscess may also form. In the upper spine, this abscess may track to and penetrate the chest wall, presenting as a soft tissue mass; in the lower spine, it may reach the inguinal ligaments or present as a psoas abscess.

Probable diagnosis is: TV endocarditis due to Staph. aureus. Here is an additional explanation: Infective endocarditis typically occurs at sites of pre-existing endocardial damage, but infection with particularly virulent or aggressive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus can cause endocarditis in a previously normal heart. Staphylococcal endocarditis of the tricuspid valve is a common complication of intravenous drug use. Many acquired and congenital cardiac lesions are vulnerable, particularly areas of endocardial damage caused by a high-pressure jet of blood, such as ventricular septal defect, mitral regurgitation and aortic regurgitation, many of which are haemodynamically insigniﬁcant. In contrast, the risk of endocarditis at the site of haemodynamically important low-pressure lesions, such as a large atrial septal defect, is minimal.

Here is an additional explanation: When plaster is mixed with water, it takes up one and a half molecules of water, i.e, it regains its water of crystallization and becomes calcium sulphate dihydrate.
(CaSO4)2.H2O + 3H2O → 2CaSO4.2H2O+ unreacted (CaSO4)2.½H2O + Heat
Hemihydrate + Water → Dihydrate + Unreacted hemihydrate + Heat
The reaction is exothermic and is the same for all gypsum products. The amount of water required to produce a workable mix varies between the products. As evident from the above reaction, not all of the hemihydrate converts to dihydrate. The amount of conversion is dependent on the type of stone. The highest conversion rate is seen in plaster (90%). In Type 4 and 5 stone, the dihydrate content is about 50%. 
Key Concept
This corresponds to the first step in the reaction. The principal constituent of gypsum-based products is calcium sulfate hemihydrate .

,"['counter', 'extrusion']","Direction of force by class III elastic in face mask? 15-20 degree downward from occlusion. Here is an additional explanation: Biomechanical Considerations
The maxilla can be advanced 2-4 mm forward over a period of 8-12 months. The amount of maxillary movement is influenced by a number of factors like:

Amount of force: Successful maxillary protraction can be brought about by 300-500 gm of force per side in the primary or mixed dentition.
Direction of force: According to most authors, a 15- 20° downward pull to the occlusal plane is required to produce forward maxillary movement.
	In most cases of maxillary deficiency, maxilla is deficient in the vertical plane as well, therefore, a slight downward, direction of force is usually desirable. The line of force passes below the center of resistance of the maxilla producing a counter-clockwise moment on the maxilla and dentition. This results in a possible extrusion of maxillary posterior teeth leading to a downward and backward rotation of the mandible.
	However, in patients with increased anterior facial height, downward pull is contradicted.
Duration of force: A review of literature shows duration to vary between 3 and 16 months. On an average at least 8-12 months of wear is required to produce the desired effect.
Frequency of use: 12-14 hrs/day.

Key Concept:
According to most authors, a 15- 20° downward pull to the occlusal plane is required to produce forward maxillary movement.

Here is an additional explanation: Down's analysis provides information by which we can determine whether the individual’s pattern shows comparatively harmonious relations or not and whether dysplasia present in a person is in the facial skeleton, the dentition or in both.
Steiner concluded that it might not be possible to correct dentition according to ideal norms in non-growing patients whose skeletal relations cannot be altered. The imperative here is to come up with an acceptable compromise for the dentition, one that will mask the underlying skeletal deformity as much as possible. This can be achieved using Steiner’s sticks, which allow calculations to be carried out for a particular ANB value.
In addition to commonly used sagittal discrepancy indicators, that is angle ANB, sagittal maxilla mandibular relationship should be reconfirmed with other variables which include WITS appraisal, A–B plane angle and beta angle. 
Key Concept:
Tweed’s analysis (originally undertaken in 1954) is primarily based on inclination of the mandibular incisors to the basal bone and the latter’s association with the vertical relation of the mandible to the cranium. Tweed’s analysis is clinically oriented. It does not directly assess the jaws.

B: Obstruction of lymphatic ductsInflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a very aggressive type of breast cancer in which the cancer cells block the lymph vessels in the skin of the breast.This type of breast cancer is called ""inflammatory"" because the breast often looks swollen and red, or ""inflamed"", sometimes overnight, and can be misdiagnosed as mastitis.Invasion of the local lymphatic ducts impairs drainage and causes edematous swelling of the breast. Because the skin of the breast is tethered by the suspensory ligament of Cooper, the accumulation of fluid may cause the skin of the breast to assume a dimpled appearance similar to an orange peel (peau d'orange).IBC is sometimes misdiagnosed as an insect bite or breast infection.

And on pervaginal examination, cervix is 50% effaced station-3, os is closed and pelvis is adequate. Protein uria is +1, Most appropriate step at the moment would be: Induce labour. Here is an additional explanation: This patient has

BP: 150/100 mm hg
Proteinuria: +1

Therefore it is classified as mild preeclampsia
In mild preeclampsia – if gestational age is > than labour induced should be 37 wks (here in the question = gestational age is >37 weeks). Here BP is 150/100, (Therefore, it is not necessary to start antihypertensive). The NICE clinical guidelines suggest treating moderate hypertension (BP-150/100-159/109 mm Hg) with antihypertensives to keep B I P <150/80-100 range. The benefits or disadvantages of this intervention have not been elucidated by adequate clinical trials.
Fernando Arias 4/e, p 209.
“There is a consensus that if BP is below 150/100 mm Hg, there is no need for antihypertensive therapy. An exception may be if mild hypertension is associated with markers of potential severe disease or sign of organ dysfunction, (heavy proteinuria, liver dysfunction, hematological dysfuntion)”.
Fernando Arias 4/e, p 209.
Thus, in this patient, the role of antihypertensive is not confirmatory as BP is 150/100 mm Hg. But role of induction of labor is confirmed, as patient is 37 weeks pregnant with mild hypertension.
PIH is not a contraindication for VBAC (Vaginal birth after cesarean) and further more that the pelvis of this patient is adequate – so there is no harm in inducing labour, rather it is advantageous, because it will help in developing lower uterine segment. At any point of time; if there is scar tenderness or if patients BP rises immediately perform cesarean section’ therefore the best answer here is – Antihypertensive regime and then induce labour",1229,"['cervix', 'pelvis']","['hematological dysfuntion', 'preeclampsia', 'organ dysfunction', 'liver dysfunction']",,

Here is an additional explanation: Well friends, we have discussed the causes and investigations of DIC. Now here let’s take a look at its management.\
Management of DIC

The most important step is to terminate the pregnancy- vaginal delivery without episiotomy is preferred to cesarean section
Volume replacement by crystalloids or colloids will reduce the amount of whole blood needed to restore the blood volume.
500 ml of fresh blood raises the fibrinogen level approximately by 12.5 mg/100 ml and platelets by 10,000–15,000 cu mm. Fresh blood- helps in flushing out fibrin degradation product and improving the micro circulation.
To replace fibrinogen- Fresh frozen plasma should be given: Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is extracted from whole blood. It contains fibrinogen, anti-thrombin III, clotting factors V, XI, XII. FFP transfusion provides both volume replacement and coagulation factors. One unit of FFP (250 mL) raises the fibrinogen by 5-10 mg/dL. FFP does not need to be ABO or Rh compatible.
Cryoprecipitate is obtained from thawed FFP. It is rich in fibrinogen, factor VIII, Von Willebrand’s factor, and XIII. Cryoprecipitate provides less volume (40 mL) compared to FFP (250 mL). So it should not be used for volume replacement. One unit of cryoprecipitate increases the fibrinogen level by 5-10 mg/dL.
In case of active bleeding with platelet counts < 50,000/ml or prophylactically with platelet count 20–30,000/ml – platelet replacement should be done. Platelet should ABO and Rh specific. 1 units (50 ml) raises the platelet count by 7500/ ml
Recombinant activated factors VIIA: (60-100 μg/kg IV) can reverse DIC within 10 minute as it is a precusor for extrinsic clotting cascade which is replaced.
Role of Heparin

According to Williams Obs. “Heparin is not used in DIC.”
According to COGDT 10/e, p 999
“Heparin acts as an anticoagulant by activating antithrombin III but has little effect on activated coagulation factors. Anticoagulation is contraindicated in patients with fulminant DIC and central nervous system insults, fulminant liver failure, or obstetric accidents. The one instance, however, in which heparin has been demonstrated to benefit pregnancy-related DIC is in the case of the retained dead fetus with intact vascular system, where heparin may be administered to interrupt the coagulation process and thrombocytopenia for several days until delivery may be implemented.”
As far as EACA is concerned- Williams Obs. 22/e, p 844 says –
“EACA is not recommended in case of DIC.”

,"['herniation', 'afp', 'hernia']","In which of the following conditions would maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein values be the highest: Gastroschisis. Here is an additional explanation: Friends, many questions are asked on serum alpha fetoprotein, therefore basic knowledge of this protein is quite vital.
Alpha Fetoprotein:

It is a glycoprotein synthesized by the fetal yolk sac in the early weeks of gestation and by the gastrointestinal tract and liver later.
It is the most abundant protein in the fetal serum.
It circulates in fetal serum and passes into fetal urine and amniotic fluid.
Concentration of AFP increases steadily in fetal serum till 13 weeks, (3 mg/ml) after which the level rapidly decreases throughout the rest of pregnancy.
AFP level in fetal serum declines following birth and by one year of age, its concentration is 1 ng/ml which persists throughout life.
AFP passes from the fetus to amniotic fluid when fetus passes urine.
It passes into the maternal serum by diffusion across the placental membranes and via placental circulation and is found in steadily increasing quantities in maternal serum after 12 weeks.

These are the usual ways of entry of serum alfa fetoprotein in maternal serum but serum alfa fetoprotein can find its way in maternal serum in other ways too.

Open fetal body wall defects uncoverd by integument permit allows additional AFP to leak into the amniotic fluid and thus maternal serum AFP are increased. This is the reason for increase in serum alpha fetoprotein in neural tube defects and ventral wall defects.
Maternal screening is done between 15-20 weeks (according to Williams 23/e, p 289, Fernando Arias 3/e, p 58).
It is measured in nanograms per ml and reported as a multiple of the median (MOM).
MSAFP of 2.5 MOM is considered as the upper limit of normal (for twin pregnancy it is 3.5 MOM).

Now after having this basic knowledge lets have a look at the question.
In the question alpha fetoprotein will be increased in the following conditions.

Gastroschisis – Ventral wall defect
Omphalocele – Ventral wall defect
Spina bifida occulta – Neural tube defect

In Down’s syndrome - AFP levels are decreased.
Spina bifida occulta:
Spina bifida occulta is usually a small, clinically asymptomatic defect, covered by skin, so there are less chances of mixing of fetal serum and maternal serum. Therefore the maternal serum alphafetoprotein level usually does not increase in spina bifida occulta.
“In the fetus with a defect such as anencephaly or spina bifida, AFP enters the amniotic fluid in increased amounts, leading to higher levels in the maternal serum as well. Levels of AFP are elevated in amniotic fluid and maternal serum only when such lesions are “open,” i.e., when the neural tissue is exposed or covered by only a thin membrane. When NTDs are skin-covered, AFP does not escape from the fetal circulation, and such defects are generally not detected by maternal serum AFP (MSAFP) screening”.
USG in Obs. and Gyane by Callen 4/e, p 25
Omphalocele: 
Fernando Arias 3/e, p 84
It is a midline defect of the anterior abdominal wall characterized by herniation of the abdominal viscera into the base of the umbilical cord.
The protruding organs are typically covered by a thin aminoperitoneal membrane. Omphalocele has a strong association with high levels of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein because the ventral wall defect allows mixing of fetal and maternal circulation.
Gastroschisis:
Fernando Arias 2/e, p 83
Gastroschisis is a paraumbilical defect of the anterior abdominal wall, through which abdominal viscera herniates. The defect is usually located on the right side of the cord insertion and compromises the full thickness of the abdominal wall. There is no sac or membrane covering the herniated organs. This defect is associated with high alpha feto protein titre.
Both gastroschisis and omphalocele are ventral wall defects containing abdominal organs and both are associated with high alphafetoprotein level in maternal serum.
But it is likely that alphafetoprotein level will be higher in patients with gastroschisis as there is no sac or membrane which covers the herniated organs in this defect. So there is more possibility of fetoprotein leak into the maternal serum or amniotic fluid in Gastroschisis. The answer is further supported by the following graph from

Staphylococcal endocarditis of the tricuspid valve is a common complication of intravenous drug use. Many acquired and congenital cardiac lesions are vulnerable, particularly areas of endocardial damage caused by a high-pressure jet of blood, such as ventricular septal defect, mitral regurgitation and aortic regurgitation, many of which are haemodynamically insigniﬁcant. In contrast, the risk of endocarditis at the site of haemodynamically important low-pressure lesions, such as a large atrial septal defect, is minimal.

Here is an additional explanation: Ans. B: Normal HbF and normal HbA2Alpha (0) thalassemia -Individuals with this disorder are not able to produce any functional alpha-globin and thus are unable to make any functional hemoglobin A, F, or A2. This leads to the development of hydrops fetalis, also known as hemoglobin Ba, a condition that is incompatible with extra uterine life.Alpha (+) thalassemia - genetic mutations that result in decreased production of alpha-globin usually due to the functional deletion of 1 of the 4 alpha globin genes. Based on the number of inherited alpha genes, it is subclassified into 3 general forms:Thalassemia (-u/ a a) is characterized by inheritance of 3 normal a-genes. These patients are referred to clinically as silent carrier of alpha thalassemia.

Leucodystrophy refers to progressive degeneration of the white matter of the brain clue to imperfect growth or development of the myelin sheath, the fatty covering that acts as an insulator around nerve fibre.
Myelin which lends its color to the white matter of the brain, is a complex substance made up of at least ten different chemicals.
The leucodystrophy are a group of disorders that are caused by genetic defects in hoW myelin produces or metabolizes these chemicals.
Each of the leucodystrophies in the result of a defect in the gene that controls one (and only one) of the chemicals. Specific leusodystrophies include -
Metachroinatic leucodystrophy          ❑ Adrenoleucodystrophy                                 

​❑ Canavan disease

Krabbe's disease                                                 ❑ Pelizaeus-Merzhacher disease                                                         ​ ❑ Alexander disease


Symptoms vary according to the specific type of leucodystrophy and may be difficult to recognize in the early stages of the disease.

Canavan's disease 

Autosomal recessive disorder
Caused due to deficiency of the enzyme N-Aspertoacylase.
This leads to accumulation of N-Acetyl aspartic acid in brain and urine.
It is characterized by the clinical traid of --> Hypotonia, Head lag, Macrocephaly 

​​Adrenoleucodvstrophy

Here is an additional explanation: Enamel is mainly composed of millions of enamel rods or prisms, sheaths and a cementing inter rod substance.
Each rod has a head and tail. 
The head is directed occlusally and the tail is directed cervically. 
Basically, acid etching creates a 5 to 50 micron deep microporous layer into which adhesive resin flows. 
This results in a long-lasting enamel bond achieved via micromechanical interlocking between the resin and enamel.
Etching produces irregular and pitted surface with numerous microscopic undercuts with uneven dissolution of heads and tails, the latter being more resistant.

Here is an additional explanation: Preanaesthetic medication refers to the use of drugs before anaesthesia to make it safe and less unpleasant. When inhalation anaesthetic are given they inhibit the ciliary function therefore secretions in the respiratory pathway are not removed so we have to stop the secretions by administration of anti cholinergic drugs like atropine or glycopyrrolate. Glycopyrrolate is twice as potent and longer acting quaternary antimuscarinic which does not produce central effects. Antisecretory action is more marked than atropine and tachycardia is less marked.

Here is an additional explanation: Red cell precursors formed in the bone marrow from the erythroid (CFU–E) progenitor cells are called erythroblasts or normoblasts. These divide and acquire haemoglobin, which turns the cytoplasm pink; the nucleus condenses and is extruded from the cell. The ﬁrst non-nucleated red cell is a reticulocyte, which still contains ribosomal material in the cytoplasm, giving these large cells a faint blue tinge (‘polychromasia’). Reticulocytes lose their ribosomal material and mature over 3 days, during which time they are released into the circulation. Increased numbers of circulating reticulocytes (reticulocytosis) reflect increased erythropoiesis.
Proliferation and differentiation of red cell precursors is stimulated by erythropoietin, a polypeptide hormone produced by renal interstitial peritubular cells in response to hypoxia. Failure of erythropoietin production in patients with renal failure causes anaemia, which can be treated with exogenous recombinant erythropoietin or similar pharmacological agents called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, e.g. darbepoetin.

ThyroxineRef Ganong 25/e p300, 24Ie p300; Harper 30Ie p501).Thyroxine is a lipophilic hormone that acts on nuclear receptor.Steroids and thyroid hormones are distinguished by their predominantly intracellular sites of action, since they can diffuse freely through the cell membrane.They bind to a family of largely cytoplasmic proteins known as nuclear receptors.Upon ligand binding, the receptor-ligand complex translocates to the nucleus where it either homodimerizes, or associates with a distinct liganded nuclear receptor to form a heterodimer.In either case, the dieter binds to DNA to either increase or decrease gene transcription in the target tissue.",1509,"['nuclear receptor', 'nuclear receptors', 'nucleus']",['thyroxine'],,

Methyl mercury is the most common form that is transformed by natural processes; it is a more toxic form than ethyl mercury (C2H5Hg+) or elemental mercury. Methyl mercury is a major safety concern because it bioaccumulates through the food chain; its pharmacokinetic half-life is longer (1.5 to 3 months) than that of ethyl mercury (less than 1 week). In air, the concentrations of mercury range from about 0.01 to 0.02 µg/m3.
Mercury accumulates in the kidneys. In the brain, metallic mercury can be converted to an inorganic form that is retained in the brain. Elemental mercury and mercury vapor have a half-life of 1 to 3 months. Mercury leaves the body by excretion through urine and feces.
Exposure to high levels of mercury can injure the brain, kidneys, and developing fetus. Chronic mercury toxicity may be manifested as tremors; memory loss; and changes in personality, vision, and hearing.

Here is an additional explanation: Uterine rupture typically is classified as either complete (all layers of the uterine wall separated) or incomplete (uterine muscle separated but visceral peritoneum is intact). Incomplete rupture is commonly referred to as scar dehiscence.
Scar dehiscence is an intraoperative finding always. The greatest risk factor for either complete or incomplete uterine rupture is prior cesarean delivery.
Following uterine rupture the most common electronic fetal monitoring finding is sudden, severe heart rate decelerations that may evolve into late decelerations, bradycardia, and undetectable fetal heart action.
In some cases in which the fetal presenting part has entered the pelvis with labor, loss of station may be detected by pelvic examination. If the fetus is partly or totally extruded from the site of uterine rupture, abdominal palpitation or vaginal examination may be helpful to identify the presenting part, which will have moved away from the pelvic inlet.
A firm contracted uterus may at times be felt alongside the fetus. With rupture and expulsion of the fetus into the peritoneal cavity, the chances for intact fetal survival are dismal, and reported morality rates range from 50% to 75%.

Congenital infections (TORCH)

So, option a & d can cause jaundice since birth.
In sickle cell anemia, affected infants do not develop symptoms in the first few months of life because the hemoglobin produced by the developing fetus (fetal hemoglobin) protects the red blood cells from sickling. This fetal hemoglobin disappears after 5 month of age so that by 5 months of age, the sickling of the red blood cells is prominent and symptoms begin.
PNH is manfested in adults.
So, both PNH and sickle cell anemia does not cause jaundice since birth.

Sign and symptoms of Brain tumors in children

Children with brain tumors frequently have symptoms and signs that strongly suggest the appropriate diagnosis.
The clinical triad of symptoms associated with increased ICT -4 headache, vomiting, blurred vision / diplopia, is the hallmark of brain tumors in childhood.
These symptoms occur more frequently with mid-line posterior fossa (infratentorial) tumors owing to the propensity of lesions close to the ventricular CSF flow system.
Symptoms of the brain tumors vary depending upon which part of the brain the tumor is found :­

Brain tumor in cerebrum (supratentorial)

Seizures                                 o Hemiperes is or Hemiplegia          o Drowsiness / confusion
Visual changes                     o T ICT (less common)                        o Personality changes

Brain tumor in brain stem

Seizures                                 o Diplopia             o Respiratory changes o T ICT (Rare)
Endocrine problem (DM) o Headache            o Cranial N. palsy

Brain tumor in cerebellum

T ECT (most common)     o Headache          o Uncoordinated movement
Vomiting                               o Ataxia

Symptoms due to raised ICT --> These are mainly caused by midline posterior fossa tumor --> Medulloblastoma.

Headache                                                    o Nausea                                                  o Drowsiness
Vomiting (usually in the morning)         o Personality changes                         o Papilledema
Diplopia / blurred vision                           o Irritability

The functional occlusal plane is also steep associated with a palatal plane that is tipped downward.
In long face individuals, who have excessive lower anterior face height, the palatal plane rotates down posteriorly, often creating a negative rather than the normal positive inclination to the true horizontal.

The α-hemihydrate form of gypsum is generally the binder for investments used in casting gold-containing alloys with melting ranges below 1000 °C. When this material is heated at temperatures sufficiently high to completely dehydrate the investment and to ensure complete castings, it shrinks considerably and occasionally fractures.
A mixture of silica and calcinated gypsum powder (calcium sulfate hemihydrate, CaSO4• 1/2 H2O) results in setting expansion greater than that of the gypsum product used alone. The silica particles probably interfere with the intermeshing and interlocking of the crystals as they form. Thus, the thrust of the crystals is outward during growth, and they increase expansion.

AD polycystic kidney is ruled out because there is no association of ADPKD with lenticonus as is mentioned in our question.

–– Alport syndrome is manifest by hematuria with progression to chronic renal failure, accompanied by nerve deafness and various eye disorders, including lens dislocation, posterior cataracts, and corneal dystrophy.
–– In about 85% cases, it is inherited as an X-linked trait. So, males express the full syndrome, and females are carriers in whom manifestations of disease are typically limited to hematuria.

Congenital diaphrogmatic hernia

Also known as ochalek hernia.
There is herniation of abdominal contents, i.e. stomach (most of the time), intestine, liver; into thorax through a defect in the diaphragm.
Females are affected more than males
More common on left side and is posterolateral.
Components of CDH are


Herniation of abdominal contents into thorax
Pulmonary hypoplasia
Malrotation of intestine


Associated anomalies may be seen 30% of cases -> CNS lesions, esophageal atresia, omphalocele and CVS lesions.
Most cases are sporadic.
CDH is a reconized part of several chromosomal syndromes ---> Trisomy 21, 18, 13, turner syndrome, Pallister-Killian, Fryn.

Clinical features

CDH may present as


Soon (within 6 hrs) after birth (most of the cases)
	or
After neonatal period (small group)

1)   Soon after birth

Respiratory distress is a cardinal sign --> presents as tachypnea, grunting, chest retraction, cyanosis.
Scaphoid abdomen
Increased chest wall diameter
Bowel sounds may be heard in the chest with decreased breath sound.


Cardiac impulse is displaced away from the side of hernia.

2)   After neonatal period

Vomiting as a result of intestinal obstruction
Mild respiratory symptoms


Occasionally, incarceration of the intestine will proceed to ischemia with sepsis and shock.

Diagnosis

Prenatal ultrasound can diagnose CDH between 16 and 14 wk.

,"['acidic', 'acidity']","Which cement is irritating to the pulp? Zinc phosphate. Here is an additional explanation: The phosphoric acid in the liquid makes the mixture quite acidic and therefore cytotoxic, when a prosthesis is luted with this cement on a prepared tooth. As setting occurs, the acidity is partially neutralized, but the cement remains acidic after 24 hours, with the pH rising from about 3 to about 6. For thin layers of dentin, a cavity liner (i.e.,Ca2) is recommended to prevent an adverse pulpal response from the pressure of luting, which forces acid into the pulp tissue. Younger patients are especially susceptible, because they have a more open dentin tubule area, whereas older patients with sclerotic dentin will have a more tortuous path that restricts the penetration of acid toward the pulp.
Key concept​​ :
pH of the cement
The acidity is high at the time of insertion due to phosphoric acid. At the time of cementation, the pH is 2 (approx.). As time passes, the acidity reduces. By the end of 24 hours, the pH is 5.5, which is still in the acidic range (neutral value is 7).

Here is an additional explanation: The killing of microbes and the destruction of ingested materials are accomplished by reactive oxygen species (ROS, also called reactive oxygen intermediates), reactive nitrogen species, mainly derived from nitric oxide (NO), and lysosomal enzymes.
Neutrophils and monocytes contain granules packed with enzymes and anti-microbial proteins that degrade microbes and dead tissues and may contribute to tissue damage. These granules are actively secretory and thus distinct from classical lysosomes. 
Neutrophils have two main types of granules:

The smaller specific (or secondary) granules contain lysozyme, collagenase, gelatinase, lactoferrin, plasminogen activator, histaminase, and alkaline phosphatase. 
The larger azurophil (or primary) granules contain MPO, bactericidal factors (such as defensins), acid hydrolases, and a variety of neutral proteases (elastase, cathepsin G, nonspecific collagenases, proteinase 3).

,['brittle'],"Phosphate bonded investment should be completely carbon free, otherwise: Carbon makes the casting brittle. Here is an additional explanation: Carbon is often added to the powder to produce clean castings and facilitate the divesting of the casting from the investment mold. This addition is appropriate when the casting alloy is gold, but there is disagreement regarding the effects of carbon in phosphate investments used for casting silver-palladium alloys, palladium-silver alloys, or base metal alloys. It is believed that carbon can embrittle the alloys, even though the investment is heated to temperatures that burn out the carbon. Some evidence indicates that palladium reacts with carbon at temperatures above 1504 °C. Thus, if the casting temperature of an alloy with high palladium content exceeds this critical point, a phosphate investment without carbon should be used.

Zone of Infection:


This is present in the center of the lesion.
It is characterized by PMNL's.


Zone of Contamination:


It is characterized by round cell inﬁltration.
It demonstrates cellular destruction due to toxins from the central zone or zone of infection. Because of autolysis and death of bone cells, the lacunae were empty.
Lymphocytes are prevalent everywhere.


Zone of Irritation:


This zone is characterized by macrophages and osteoclasts.
The collagen framework was digested by phagocytic cells, the macrophages, while osteoclasts attacked the bone tissue. This opens a gap in the bone all around the center of lesion. That space becomes ﬁlled with PMNL's. It contains cholesterol crystals.
This zone demonstrates much activity preparatory to repair.


Zone of Stimulation: (Peripheral zone)


This zone is characterized by ﬁbroblasts and osteoblasts.
In this zone, the eﬀects of toxins were mild enough to be stimulant which results in laying down of collagen ﬁbers around the zone of irritation that acts both as a wall of defense and as a scaﬀolding on which the osteoblasts built new bone.

Trisomy 21 accounts for nearly 95% of all patients with Down syndrome.
It is now generally accepted that there are at least three forms of Down syndrome: 

One in which there is the typical trisomy 21 with 47 chromosomes (accounting for about 95% of cases)
Another termed the translocation type, in which there appear to be only 46 chromosomes, although the extra chromosome material of number 21 is translocated to another chromosome of G or D group, either 21/22 translocation or 21/21 translocation (about 3% of cases)

I. Pulmonary flow ductal dependence.

Newborns with congenital heart disease who are dependent on the potency of their ductus for pulmonary blood flow present with varying degrees of cyanosis.
Critical Pulmonary Valve Stenosis with Intact Ventricular Septum.

Li Tricuspid Atresia:

Tetralogy of Fallot 
	Ni Systemic flow ductal dependence.


These newborns are dependent on their ductus arteriosus for systemic blood flow and unlike the babies who are pulmonary flow dependent, these newborns present with severely decreased cardiac output.
This decreased systemic flow is characterized by pallor, diminished peripheral pulses, low urine output, cool extremities and varying degrees of metabolic acidosis.
This includes newborns with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction at various levels.


Congenital Valvular Aortic Stenosis

The reason for the development of allergy is the presence of plasma and the process of washing helps in the removal of residual plasma. if the Patient is having a history of allergy - Antihistaminic drugs -reduce the chances of development of allergic reactions during blood transfusion. 2. Irradiation - reduces the chance of development of Graft Versus Host Disease. Irradiation - causes - reduction in the number of the immunocompetent cells (lymphocytes mainly) Irradiation of cellular blood components (red blood cells, platelets, and granulocytes) is indicated to prevent the development of transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD). Patients at risk of TA-GVHD include immunocompromised patients who are receiving a bone marrow or stem cell transplant and fetuses undergoing an intrauterine transfusion. Irradiation is also indicated for recipients of components collected from a blood relative or HLA-matched donors. 3. Leukocyte reduction - Leukoreduction of whole blood and blood components has been shown to reduce recurrent febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions, reduce alloimmunization to leukocyte antigens that may complicate care of patients whoundergo transplantation or chronic transfusion therapy, and protect against transmission of cytomegalovirus (CMV) to patients at increased risk of CMV disease. antibodies in the recipient - react with donor leukocytes - release of cytokines - cause fever- known as Febrile Non-Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction. 4.

Congenital conjugated hyperbilirubinemia
1)Dubin Jhonson syndrome 

DJS is a type of congenital conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.
It is autosomal recessive.
Conjugated bilirubin is increased because of defective biliary excretion of bilirubin glucuronides due to mutation in canalicular multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP 2).
Liver function tests are normal
A cardinal feature of DJS is the accumulation in the lysosome of centrilobular hepatocytes of dark, coarsely granular pigment. As a result, the liver is black in appearance. This pigment is thought to be derived from epinephrine metabolites that are not excreted normally.
There is increased urinary excretion of coproporphyrine I (normal coproporphyrine III is more excreted), but total coproporphyrine level is normal.
Gall bladder is not visualized on oral cholecystography.
After iv administration, there is reflux of conjugated sulfobromophthalein (Bromsulphalein, BSP) from liver to circulation.

2)Rotor syndrome

Rotor syndrome is a type of congenital conjugated hyperbilimbinemia.
It is autosomal recessive.
It is due to decreased biliary excretion of conjugated bilirubin and also due to decrease hepatic uptake & storage of bilirubin.

Liver is not pigment
Coproporphyrine I is increased in urine but total coproporphyrine level is also increased.

,"['swelling', 'hyperplastic', 'hypothyroidism']","Short child with low T4 and raised TSH and swelling of pituitary, what is the diangosis ? Primary hypothyrodism. Here is an additional explanation: Normally, T4 and T3 exert negative feedback on TSH secretion by pituitary in two ways:


Block the secretion of TSH by pituitary directly --> major action
Block the secretion of TRH by hypothalamus (TRH stimulates the secretion of TSH by pituitary)


In primary hypothyrodism, T4 and T3 are not produced or produced in low concentration by thyroid. This results in abolition of negative feedback on TSH secretion. Thus, there is elevated TSH and pituitary can become hyperplastic to produce more TSH.
In pituitary cause of hypothyroidism (secondary hypothyroidism) both TSH and Thyroid hormone (T4, T3) are low as pituitary does not secrete TSH and TSH is the major stimulation for production of T4 and T3.

About option d

TSH resistance can also produce same picture i.e. raised TSH and low T4 with pituitary swelling.
There is thyroid insensitivity to TSH which results in hypothyroidism (1T4 and T3). Because of reduced thyroid hormone feedback, TSH is markedly elevated.
However, Amongst the given options best option is primary hypothyrodism because TSH resistance is a very rare condition and further T4 levels are normal in Mild and moderate (Partial) TSH resistance.",2029,['pituitary'],"['hypothyrod', 'diangosis', 'hypothyrodism']",,

Alterations in gonadotropin releasing hromone pulsatality leads to preferential production of LH, as compared to FSH. Also estrogen has a positive feedback on LH and negative feedback on FSH which leads to increase in LH and decrease in FSH such that LH/FSH is > 2.1.
Now the question arises whether this increase in LH is persistent. Most of the books do not state anything clearly except that there is an increase in the LH pulse amplitude and frequency.

The optimal operating potential of dental X-ray units is between 60 and 70 kVp (ADA 2012).
Although image diagnosis may be improved slightly with increased image contrast (low kVp) images, the patient dose is reduced with higher kVp exposures. Most intraoral machines use 60 to 70 kVp. The availability of constant-potential (fully rectified), high-frequency or direct current (DC) dental X-ray units have made possible the production of radiographs with lower kilovoltage and at reduced levels of radiation. The surface exposure required to produce a comparable radiographic density using a constant-potential unit is approximately 25% less than that of a conventional self-rectified unit operating at the same kilovoltage. At the present time, several manufacturers produce DC units.

WHat is your diagnosis? BPPV. Here is an additional explanation: Positional veigo/ BPPV: It is characterized by veigo when the head is placed in a ceain critical position. There is no hearing loss or other neurologic symptoms. Positional testing establishes the diagnosis and helps to differentiate it from positional veigo of central origin. Disease caused by a disorder of posterior semicircular canal though many patients have history of head trauma and ear infection. It has been demonstrated that otoconial debris, consisting of crystals and calcium carbonate, is released from the degeneration macula of the utricle and floats freely in the endolymph. When it settles on the cupula of posterior semicircular canal in a critical head position, it causes displacement of the cupula and veigo. The veigo is fatigable on assuming the same position repeatedly due to dispersal of the otoconia but can be induced again after a period of rest. Thus, typical history and Hallpike maneuver establishes the diagnosis. The condition can be treated by performing Epley's maneuver. The principle of this maneuver is to reposition the otoconial debris from the posterior semicircular canal back into the utricle. The doctor stands behind the patient and the assistant on the side. The patient is made to sit on the table so that when he is made to lie down, his head is beyond the edge of the table as is done in Dix-Hallpike maneuver. His face is turned 450 to the affected side. The maneuver consists of five positions * Position 1. With the head turned 450, the patient is made to lie down in head-hanging position (Dix-Hallpike). It will cause veigo and nystagmus. Wait till veigo and nystagmus subside. * Position 2. Head is now turned so that affected ear is facing up at a 900 rotation. * Position 3. The whole body and head are now rotated away from the affected ear to a lateral recumbent position in a 900 -rotation face-down position. * Position 4. Patient is now brought to a sitting position with head still turned to the unaffected side by 450. * Position 5. The head is now turned forward and chin brought down 200. There should be a pause at each position till there is no nystagmus or there is slowing of nystagmus, before changing to the next position. After maneuver is complete, patient should maintain an upright posture for 48 h. Eighty percent of the patients will be cured by a single maneuver. If the patients remain symptomatic, the maneuver can be repeated.

Symptoms may be mild for many patients, but if left untreated, it can lead to delirium tremens, an uncommon but severe and life-threatening manifestation of withdrawal marked by severe hallucinations, disorientation, and autonomic overactivity. Symptoms and signs include the following: Profoundly delirious state associated with tremulousness and agitation. Excessive motor activity (most notable as a tremor that affects the face, tongue, and extremities but that may also involve speech) and purposeless activity such as picking at the bedclothes. Hallucinations, classically visual rather than auditory, are a prominent feature. Autonomic nervous system hyperactivity: tachycardia, dilated pupils, fever, and hyperhidrosis.

Autoimmune hemolysis leads to the formation of spherocytes and not schistocytes.

Mandibular molars, mainly first molars, may also have an additional root located lingually or buccally. Although this is a rare occurrence in Caucasian populations, it is more common in Asian populations.

On examination the heart rate is 190/minute, blood pressure 50/30 mmHg, respiratory rate 72 breaths/minute and capillary refill time of 4 seconds. Investigations show hemoglobin level of 15 g/dl. Na 120 mEq/l, K 6.8 mEq/l, Cl 81 meq/l, bicarbonate 15 mEq/l, urea 30 mg/dl and creatinine 0.6 mg/dl. the most likely diagnosis is – Acute tubular necrosis. Here is an additional explanation: Both the serum creatinine and serum urea are abnormal in this neonate. They may be normal for an adult, but for an 8 day old infant they are elevated.
First the serum creatinine level
 
The serum creatinine level is high at birth reflecting the maternal value but it falls rapidly to 0.4 mg/dl by the end of the first week.
According to Nelson, creatinine level in various age groups are
Cord blood     ______ >      0.6 —1.2 mg/di
New born _______ >       0.3 — 1.0 mg/dl
Infant       ______ >                           0.2 - 0.4 mg/di
Child       ______ >                           0.3 - 0.7 mg/di
Adolescent ______ >       0.5 — 1.0 mg/di
Do not get confused by the creatinine level of the newborn i.e., 0.3 — 1.0 mg/dl.
This high level reflects the maternal value and it comes down to 0.2 to 0.4 mg/dl by 5th day
So, Creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dl is abnormally high in an 8 day old infant.
Now, the serum urea level
The serum urea level in cord blood is 21-40 mg/dl, but it falls rapidly to 3-12 mg/dl by the 4th or 5th day.
So urea level of 30 mg/dl is abnormally high in an 8 day old infant.
According to Nelson Serum urea level in various age group
Cord blood   ______ >                     21-40 ing/dl
Premature      ______ >                    3-25 mg/dl
Newborn   ______ >                         3-12 mg/dl
Infant/child _____ >       5-18 ing/d1
Now, the capillary refill time
Capillary refill time is also prolonged here (N ---> < 3 seconds)
Prolonged capillary refill time indicates loss offluid and indicates shock, heart failure, Sympathetic stimulation

Auriculotemporal syndrome. Here is an additional explanation: Auriculotemporal Syndrome (Frey's Syndrome, Gustatory Sweating)
The auriculotemporal syndrome is an unusual phenomenon, which arises as a result of damage to the auriculotemporal nerve and subsequent reinnervation of sweat glands by parasympathetic salivary fibres.
Clinical Features 
The patient typically exhibits flushing and sweating of the involved side of the face, chiefly in the temporal area, during eating. The severity of this sweating may often be increased by tart foods. Of further interest is the fact that profuse sweating may be evoked by the parenteral administration of pilocarpine or eliminated by the administration of atropine or by a procaine block of the auriculotemporal nerve.
There is a form of gustatory sweating which occurs in otherwise normal individuals when they are eating certain foods, particularly spicy or sour ones. This consists of diffuse facial sweating, not simply a perioral sweating and may even be on a hereditary basis.

Neonatal behavioral response grading – State 6. Here is an additional explanation: Neonatal behavioral assessment scale

Neonatal Behavioural Assessment Scale (NBAS) is used to support parents in the neonatal unit, especially around discharge home. The aim is to increase parents' confidence in understanding their baby.
An infant's reaction are state related. So it is extremely important that observations of state be considered as a starting point from which all other observations are made.
The ideal time to administer the examination is when the infant is asleep and midway between feeding cycles.

Scores 
Sleep states

State 1 : Sleep with regular breathing, eyes closed, no spontaneous activity except startles or jerky movements at quite regular intervals.

a State 2 : Sleep with eyes closed; rapid eye movements can often be observed under closed lids; low activity level with random movements and startles.
Awake states

State 3 : Drowsy or semidrowsy; eyes may be open but dull and heavy lidded, or closed, eyelids fluttering; activity level minimal, Movements are usually smooth, although there may be startles. Some infants may also show fuss/cry vocalizations in this state. What distinguishes state 3 from state 5 when both are accompanied by fuss/cry vocalizations is the minimal movement in state 3 and considerable movement in state 5.
State 4 : Alert, eyes open with bright look. Motor activity is minimal; there can be a glazed look that is easily changed into a brighter look with appropriate stimulation.


State 5 : Eyes likely to be open; considerable motor activity, with thrusting movements of the extremities, and even a few spontaneous startles; reactive to external stimulation with increase in startles or motor activity.


State 6 : Crying : characterized by intense, loud, rhythmic, and sustained cry vocalizations that are difficult to break through with stimulation; motor activity is high.

Coming to the question

According to above staging, the newborn in our question comes under state 6 (crying lustily, and moving all 4 limbs).
If you have any confusion, read the following facts on crying (state 6) :-

""it is important to distinguish between crying as a state (stage 6) from the fuss/ay vocalization that can occur in state 5 and even state 3. Some infants show repeated episodes of fuss /cry vocalization in state 5 but may not reach state 6. This may also be a maturational issue, because some preterm infants may not have energy reserves to sustain state 6. In general, state 6 Can be distinguished from state 5 by the intensity and sustained quality of the crying (at least 15 seconds) and unavailability of infant in state 6. Repeated brief episodes of cry /fuss in state 5 do not mean that the infant has moved into state 6. Examiners need to give the infant the opportunity to show state 6""

So, crying lustily with all limbs moving (child in question), straight away goes in state 6.",2378,,,,

Here is an additional explanation: The surface of NiTi is rougher (because of surface defects, not the quality of polishing) than that of beta-Ti, which in turn is rougher than steel. However, there is little or no correlation for orthodontic wires between the coefficients of friction and surface roughness. (i.e., interlocking and plowing are not significant components of the total frictional resistance). 
Although NiTi has greater surface roughness, beta-Ti has greater frictional resistance, it turns out that as the titanium content of an alloy increases, its surface reactivity increases, and the surface chemistry is a major influence on frictional behavior. Thus, beta-Ti, at 80% titanium, has a higher coefficient of friction than NiTi at 50% titanium, and there is greater frictional resistance to sliding with either than with steel.
Key Concept
Although NiTi has greater surface roughness, beta-Ti has greater frictional resistance.

,['disease'],"A screening test is used in same way in two similar populations, but the proportion of false positive results among those who test positive in population A is lower than among those who test positive in population B. What is the likely explanation for this finding? The prevalence of disease is higher in population A. Here is an additional explanation: Total population having the disease : ‘a + c’ (TP + FN)
Total population not having the disease : ‘b + d’ (FP + TN)
Total population: a + b + c + d = TP + FP + FN + TN

PPV depends on sensitivity, specificity and prevalence of disease in the population.
Now in this question, a screening test is used in same way in two similar populations; thereby the screening test will have similar sensitivity and specificity in both populations.
PPV = a/ (a + (b) X 100, thus b (False Positive rate) is inversely proportional to PPV; and PPV is directly proportional to Prevalence of disease in a population.
So, False Positive rate (FP rate) is inversely proportional to the prevalence of disease in the population.
Therefore, if the same screening test is having lower FP rate in population A (as compared to a similar population B), then this could be explained by higher prevalence of disease in population A

Key Points 
HBsAg:

The antigen appears in blood during incubation period and is detectable in most patients during the prodrome and acute phase of the disease.
Persistent presence of HBsAg in blood for at least 6 months indicates the carrier state and also indicates the risk of chronic hepatitis and hepatic carcinoma. It is not detectable in the serum during convalescent stage. The presence of HBsAg alone does not necessarily indicate the replication of complete virion, and the patients may not have symptoms of liver damage.

Congenital disease in diabetes mellitus
Option a i.e. Results due to free radical injury - True -
Congenital malformation in a case of diabetes can be due to variety of reasons like, Dutta Obs. 6/e, p 287

Genetic susceptibility
Hyperglycemia - It is seen that good glycemic control indicated by HbAIC levels < %.9 can significantly lower the risk of fetal malformation.
Arachidonic acid deficiency
Ketone body formation
Free Radical injury
Somatomedin inhibition.

Option b–6 to 10% cases are associated with major congenital abnormality
Here we will have to read the option very carefully - the option is talking about Major congenital anomalities and not all anomalies.
Dutta Obs 6/e, p- 287 says overall incidence of congenital Malformations is 6-10%.
Williams 24/e p 1128. “The incidence of major malformations in women with type I diabetes is ~ 5%”
Hence option b is incorrect
Option c - 1 - 2% of newborns are associated with single umbilical artery
This option can be taken in + /– status because no where the incidence of single umbilical artery in a case of diabetes has been mentioned separately.
Whatever little information we have is from Dutta Obs. 6/e, p 220
Single umbilical artery:

It is present in 1-2% cases (overall)
May be due to failure of development of artery or due to its atrophy in later months
It is seen in case of

i. Twins
ii. Babies born to diabetic mothers
iii. In polyhydramines

Single umbilical artery has been associated with congenital malformations of the fetus in 10-20% cases viz- Renal & Genital anomalies and fetal Trisomy
There is increased incidence of abortions, prematurity, IUGR and increased perinatal mortality.

The epidemiology of acute Rheumatic fever is identical to that of group A streptococcal upper respiratory tract infection.
As is the case of streptococcal sore throat, acute rheumatic fever most often occurs in children, the peak age related incidence is between 5-15 years.
Epidemiological risk factor for rheumatic fever, include lower standards of living especially crowding, the disease has been more common among socially and economically disadvantaged populations.

Pathogenesis of Rheumatic fever

It is strongly suspected that acute Rheumatic fever is a hypersensitivity reaction induced by group A streptococci but the exact pathogenesis remains uncertain despite many years of investigation.
Although the precise factor or factors that confer this property are unknown, highly rheumatogenic strains, share certain biological characteristic.
It is believed that antibodies directed against the M proteins of certain strains cross reacts with glycoprotein antigens in the heart, joints and other tissues. These strains are (1, 3, 5, 6, 18).
The M proteins molecules has a particular surface exposed antigenic domain against which Rheumatic fever patients mount a strong antibody response.

Figure shows the neuroanatomy of the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, where ADH is synthesized and released. The hypothalamus contains two types of magnocellular (large) neurons that synthesize ADH in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, about five sixths in the supraoptic nuclei and about one sixth in the paraventricular nuclei. Both of these nuclei have axonal extensions to the posterior pituitary.
The most important renal action of ADH is to increase the water permeability  of  the  distal  tubule,  collecting  tubule, and collecting duct epithelia. This effect helps the body to conserve water in circumstances such as dehydration. In the absence of ADH, the permeability of the distal tubules and collecting ducts to water is low, causing the kidneys to excrete large amounts of dilute urine, a condition called diabetes insipidus. Thus, the actions of ADH play a key role in controlling the degree of dilution or concentration of the urine.",2527,"['supraoptic nuclei', 'hypothalamus', 'paraventricular nuclei', 'pituitary gland', 'supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus', 'distal tubules', 'posterior pituitary', 'collecting duct epithelia', 'kidneys', 'supraoptic', 'collecting ducts', 'posterior pituitary insufficiency', 'collecting tubule', 'distal tubule']",['diabetes insipidus'],,

But this cannot help us to solve this question.
Let’s see what Williams Obs. has to say on Origin of Amniotic fluid.
“In early pregnancy, amniotic fluid is an ultrafiltrate of maternal plasma. By the beginning of second trimester, it consists largely of extracellular fluid which diffuses through the fetal skin, and thus reflects the composition of fetal plasma”.
After 20 weeks, however, the cornification of fetal skin prevents this diffusion and amniotic fluid is composed largely of fetal urine.”

The term shoulder dystocia is used to define a wide range of difficulties encountered in the delivery of the shoulders (A head to body delivery time exceeding 60 secs defines shoulder dystocia).
Risk factors: Shoulder dystocia can occur in all those conditions where fetus is too big or in case of mismanaged labour.
D-Maternal diabetes
O-Maternal obesity and fetal obesity, i.e macrosomia
P-Post-term pregnancy
A-Anencephaly, Fetal ascites
Management of shoulder dystocia:
Shoulder dystocia should be managed as quickly as possible as interval of time from delivery of head to delivery of body is of great importance as far as survival of baby is concerned. Management follows a sequence of steps together called as Shoulder Dystocia Drill.
First line measures:

Immediately after recognition of shoulder dystocia extra help should be called, in the form of midwifery assistance, an obstetrician, a paediatric resuscitation team and an anaesthetist.
Maternal pushing should be discouraged, as this may lead to further impaction of the shoulder, thereby exacerbating the situation.
Liberal episiotomy should be given to provide more space posteriorly.
Fundal pressure should not be employed. As it is associated with an unacceptably high neonatal complication rate and may result in uterine rupture.
Moderate suprapubic pressure can be applied by the assistant.
McRoberts’ manoeuvre is the single most effective intervention and should the first maneouvre to be performed. The
McRobert’s manoeuvre is flexion and abduction of the maternal hips, positioning the maternal thighs on her abdomen.

Second line measures: They should be done only, if first line measures fail:

Wood’s manoeuvre: It is progressively rotating the posterior shoulder by 180°. So that the impacted anterior shoulder is released.

Third line measures—They should be done only, if second line measures fail:

Carbon steel alloy contains 0.5 to 1.5 percent carbon in iron.
Instruments made from carbon steel are known for their hardness and sharpness.
Disadvantages with these instruments are their susceptibility to corrosion and fracture. They are of two types:

1. Soft steel: It contains <0.5% carbon
2. Hard steel: It contains 0.5 to 1.5% carbon
Stainless Steel

Stainless steel alloy contains 72 to 85 percent iron, 15 to 25 percent chromium and 1 to 2 percent carbon.
Instruments made from stainless steel remain shiny bright because of deposition of chromium oxide layer on the surface of the metal which reduces the tendency to tarnish and corrosion.
Problem with stainless steel instruments is that they tend to lose their sharpness with repeated use, so they need to be sharpened again and again.

Metronidazole is a prodrug requiring reductive activation of the nitro group by susceptible organisms.
 Unlike their aerobic counterparts, anaerobic and microaerophilic pathogens contain electron transport components that have a sufficiently negative redox potential to donate electrons to metronidazole.
 The single-electron transfer forms a highly reactive nitro radical anion that kills susceptible organisms by radical-mediated mechanisms that target DNA.

3. Congenital heart disease and Mitral valve prolapse have the best prognosis
So now this question becomes very easy-Mitarl vave prolapse has the best prognosis, so it is ruled out; Regurgitant lesions have a better prognosis than stenotic lesions so mitral regurgitation is also ruled out. Now we are left with 2 options, aortic stenosis and pulmonary stenosis-as I said go alphabetically, aortic stenosis will have a worse prognosis than pulmonary.
Let’s consider each of the options one by one and see what Williams has to say about each of them.
Option “a” Mitral regurgitation
“M R is well-tolerated during pregnancy probably due to decreased systemic vascular resistance which actually results in less regurgitation. Heart failure only rarely develops during pregnany.”

Here is an additional explanation: If the tooth has been out for 15 minutes to 60 minutes:
Tooth with closed apex

Clean the root surface with saline.
Do not touch a viable root with hands, forceps, gauze or anything, or try to scrub or clean it to avoid injury to
the periodontal ligament which makes it difficult to revascularize the reimplanted tooth.
Examine alveolar socket after cleaning it with saline. Do not overlook fracture of tooth and alveolar ridge.
Reimplant the tooth gently with firm finger pressure. Ask the patient to bite down firmly on a piece of gauze to help stabilize the tooth.
After evaluating the occlusion, stabilize the tooth if required. Ideal splint required for an avulsed tooth is a flexible splint. The commonly used flexible splints are made of Gortex, metallic mesh stripes, synthetic clothes or orthodontic wire. A thick strip of composite bonded to the avulsed and the adjacent teeth also act as a splint.

The splint should engage several teeth around the avulsed tooth and it should be kept in place for not more than 7 to 10 days.

Continue with the same treatment as above.

Tooth with open apex:

Clean the root surface with saline.
Examine the alveolar socket after cleaning it with saline.
Cover the root surface with minocycline hydrochloride microspheres before reimplanting to kill bacteria which could enter the immature apex and form an abscess.
Continue with the same treatment as above.

Kawasaki disease

Kawasaki disease, also known as lymph node syndrome, mucocutaneous-lymph node syndrome, and infant polyarteritis, is a poorly understood self-limited vasculitis that affects many organs, including the skin mucous membrane, lymph nodes, heart and blood vessel walls.
It is usually seen in children younger than 5 years.
Kawasaki disease predominantly affect medium sized vessels, but may also affect small or large vessels.

Presentation

Presenting features may be divided into : -

1. Mucocutaneous, lymphnode involved

Often begins with high grade fever.


Erythma of mouth, red cracked lips, a strawberry tongue.
Bilateral conjuctival injection with iritis and keratic precipitate.
Red palms and soles
Rash, which may take many forms (but not vesicular), on trunk.
Rash with peeling of skin in genital area perineal desquamation.
Cervical lymphadenopathy
Beau's lines (transverse grooves on nails).


Arthralgia

2. Heart

The cardiac complications are the most important aspect of the disease.
These are due to coronary vasculitis.


Vasculitis causes coronary ectasia and coronary artery aneurism.


Aneurism may lead to MI and sudden death.


Myocarditis, pericarditis with small pericardial effusion.


Valvular regurgitation

Leg vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism: The older preparations increased the incidence of venous thromboembolism, but this is found to be less marked (only 2-3 patients per 1000 women years) with the newer reduced steroid content pills. However, even low-dose pills pose significant risk in women > 35 years of age, diabetics, hypertensives and in those who smoke. The excess risk is due to the estrogen component of the OC, and normalizes shortly after stopping the OC.
Rise in BP: Occurred in 5-10% women taking the earlier pills. The again is less frequent and smaller in magnitude with the low-dose pills of today. If the BP rises, best is to stop OCs: the BP normalizes in the next 3-6 months. Both the estrogen and progestin components are responsible for this effect, probably by increasing plasma angiotensinogen level and renin activity which have been found to be raised during OC use. Aldosterone secretion is enhanced resulting in salt and water retention.

The tumor mass is attached to the tooth root and appears as a well-circumscribed dense radiopaque mass often surrounded by a thin, uniform radiolucent line. The outline of the affected root is generally obliterated, because of resorption of the root and fusion of the mass to the tooth.
The associated tooth is vital, unless coincidentally involved. The lesion is slow-growing and may cause expansion of cortical plates of bone, but is usually otherwise asymptomatic.

The graph shows the relative viscosities and working times of zinc phosphate, polycarboxylate, and GICs as they set. 
A cool slab lengthens the working time for zinc carboxylate cement, although it causes the polyacrylic acid to thicken, which hinders mixing. 
Refrigerating the powder is useful, because it retards the reaction without raising the viscosity of the liquid.
Polycarboxylate cements are more viscous than a comparable mix of GIC; however, the polycarboxylate mix undergoes thinning at an increased shear rate.

Here is an additional explanation: The incidence of secondary caries is markedly less around silicate restorations. This is surprising when considering that severe leakage takes place at its margins. 
Also, the incidence of contact caries is less when compared to amalgam restorations (contact caries is the term applied to caries occurring on the proximal surface of the tooth adjacent to the restoration). 
The anti-cariogenic property is due to presence of 15% fluoride. Fluoride release is slow and occurs throughout the life of the restoration. Silicate cement was classed as a severe irritant to the pulp because of its low pH (acidic). 
For many years, silicate served as a standard for comparing the pulpal response to other materials. In deep cavities, the pulp had to be protected with varnish or calcium hydroxide.

Here is an additional explanation: Resuscitation of neonate born through meconium-stained liquer (MSL) 

When baby passes meconium in utero, there is a chance that the mecomium will be aspirated into infant's mouth and potentially into the trachea and lungs.
Appropriate steps must be taken immediately after delivery to reduce the risk of serious consequences resulting from aspiration of meconium.
Intrapartum nasopharyngeal suctioning just after the delivery of head is no longer recommended as it does not reduce the risk of meconium aspiration syndrome and, on rare occasions, may cause nasophagngeal trauma or a cardiac arrhythmia.

The first step after delivery is to identify whether the newborn is vigrous or non-vigrous : -
A) Vigrous newborn

A newborn is classified as vigrous, if he has all the three signs are present : -


Strong respiratory effort
Good muscle tone
Heart rate greater than 100


The vigrous child does not require any tracheal suctioning and the usual initial steps of resuscitation are provided, i.e., provide warniith, positioning, suctioning of mouth and nose (not tracheal suctioning); Dry, stimulate and 02 if necessary.

B) Non-vigrous newborn

If any of the above three signs is present, the newborn is classified as non-vigrous.
For non-vigrous child, the initial steps are modified : -


Place the baby under radiant wanner and postpone suctioning to prevent stimulation of posterior pharyngeal wall that can cause bradycardia.
Residual meconium in the mouth and posterior pharynx should be removed by suctioning under direct vision using a laryngoscope.
The trachea should then be intubated and mechonium suctioned from the lower airway. Tracheal suctioning is best done by applying suction directly to the endotracheal tube.

The external appearance of genitalia was normal, except hyperpigmentation. lood glucose showed a level of 30 mg%. What is the most probable diagnosis ? Familial glucocorticoid deficiency. Here is an additional explanation: Familial glucocorticoid deficiency :

Familial glucocorticoid deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive condition.
It is characterized by adrenal insufficiency.
The pathological examination of the adrenal gland reveals that :-


Zona glomerulosa ---> well preserved.
Zona fasciculata ---> atrophied.
Zona reticularis  ---> atrophied.


This causes low cortisol concentration because the zona fasciculata is primarily responsible for glucocorticoid production.
Because the zona glomerulosa is well preserved mineralocorticoid action is usually unaffected.
Low circulating serum cortisol results in lack of feedback inhibition to the hypothalamus which results in increased ACTH secretion from pituitary.

Clinical features :

Patients with familial glucocorticoid deficiency generally presents with signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency with the important distinction that mineralocorticoid production is always normal.
The most common initial presenting sign is deep hyperpigmentation of the skin, mucous membrane or both as a result of the action of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) on cutaneous melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) receptors.
The symptoms are compatible with glucocorticoid deficiency. Many patients presents with recurrent hypoglycemia or severe infections.
In the neonatal period, frequent presenting signs include - feeding problems, failure to thrive, regurgitation and hypoglycemia manifesting as seizures.",2844,"['genitalia', 'zona fasciculata', 'zona reticularis', 'skin', 'mucous membrane', 'zona glomerulosa', 'adrenal gland', 'pituitary', 'hypothalamus']","['familial', 'glucocorticoid deficiency', 'infections', 'glucocorticoid', 'adrenal insufficiency']",['10–month old'],['baby']

Chemical fixatives can be considered as members of three major categories: coagulant, cross-linking, and compound. Coagulant fixatives: Both organic and non-organic solutions may coagulate proteins making them insoluble. Cellular architecture in vivo is maintained primarily by lipoproteins and fibrous proteins such as collagen. Coagulating these proteins maintains tissue histomorphology at the light microscope level. Unfounately, because coagulant fixatives result in cytoplasmic flocculation and poor preservation of mitochondria and secretory granules, these fixatives are not useful in ultrastructural analysis. Examples: Ethanol, methanol, acetone, picric acid and trichloroacetic acid Cross-linking fixatives: Several chemicals were selected as fixatives secondary to their potential actions of forming cross-links both within and between proteins and nucleic acids. Examples include formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde and other aldehydes, e.g. chloral hydrate and glyoxal, as well as metal salts, e.g. mercuric and zinc chloride, and other metallic compounds, e.g. osmium tetroxide. useful for electron microscopic examination - Glutraldehyde (best one)/formaldehyde/osmium tetraoxide Compound fixatives: Alcoholic formalin",2846,"['mitochondria', 'lipoproteins', 'nucleic acids', 'fibrous proteins', 'cytoplasmic', 'secretory granules']",,,

 Pharyngeal diverticula are formed by outpouching of the dehiscence. Such diverticula are normal in the pig. Pharyngeal diverticula are often attributed to neuromuscular incoordination in this region which may be due to the fact that different nerves supply the two parts of the inferior constrictor.
 The propulsive thyropharyngeus is supplied by the pharyngeal plexus, and sphincteric cricopharyngeus, by the recurrent laryngeal nerve.

,"['rigid body', 'viscous fluid', 'liquid']","Which of the following type of flow occurs, when on applying critical shear stress, a material turns to liquid? Bingham body behaviour. Here is an additional explanation: The viscosity of many dental materials decreases with increasing strain rate until it reaches a nearly constant value. That is, the faster they are stirred, forced through a syringe, or squeezed, the less viscous and more fluid they become. This is pseudoplastic viscosity and is illustrated by the change in slope of the plot in the figure.
The viscosity of a pseudoplastic fluid decreases with increasing shear rate. 
The tomato-based food condiment ketchup is also pseudoplastic, which makes it difficult to remove from a bottle. Shaking the bottle or rapping the side of the bottle increases its shear rate, decreases its viscosity, and improves its pourability.

Zone of infection

Zone of irritation
Zone of stimulation


Zone of Infection:


This is present in the center of the lesion.
It is characterized by PMNL's.


Zone of Contamination:


It is characterized by round cell inﬁltration.
It demonstrates cellular destruction due to toxins from the central zone or zone of infection. Because of autolysis and death of bone cells, the lacunae were empty.
Lymphocytes are prevalent everywhere.


Zone of Irritation:


This zone is characterized by macrophages and osteoclasts.
The collagen framework was digested by phagocytic cells, the macrophages, while osteoclasts attacked the bone tissue. This opens a gap in the bone all around the center of lesion. That space becomes ﬁlled with PMNL's.
This zone demonstrates much activity preparatory to repair.


Zone of Stimulation: (Peripheral zone)


This zone is characterized by ﬁbroblasts and osteoblasts.
In this zone, the eﬀects of toxins were mild enough to be stimulant which results in laying down of collagen ﬁbers around the zone of irritation that acts both as a wall of defense and as a scaﬀolding on which the osteoblasts built new bone.

Prothrombin is coagulant factor II. Its formation in liver is dependant on fat soluble vitamin K. Absorption of vitamin K occurs with bile acid. In cholestasis absorption of bile acid (vitamin K) is not affected, rather there is accumulation of bile acids, so levels of vitamin K and clotting factors dependant on vitamin K are also normal. The prothrombin time therefore, remains normal in cholestasis.

Primidone A deoxybarbiturate, which is converted by liver to phenobarbitone and phenylethyl malonamide (PEMA). Its antiepileptic activity is mainly due to these active metabolites because t1/2 of primidone (6-14 hr) is less than that of its active metabolites. About 1/3 primidone is excreted unchanged by kidney. Dose to dose primidone is less potent, but antiepileptic efficacy is similar to phenobarbitone. It is seldom used now in GTGC and partial epilepsy, mainly as an adjuvant to phenytoin or carbamazepine.
Adverse effects are similar to phenobarbitone. In addition, anemia, leukopenia, psychotic reaction and lymph node enlargement occur rarely.

,"['aneuploid', 'monosomy', 'normal']","All are true about aneuploidy except: Occurrence of aneuploidy has no relation with the progression of mother's age. Here is an additional explanation: Aneuploidy

Each human cell consists of 23 pair of chromosomes i.e., the normal chromosome number is 46
Aneuploidy is a deviation from the normal number of 46 chromosome. Which could be be 47 or 45 chromosomes or it can be defined as state of having chromosome number that is not multiple of 23.

Nondisjunction

Nondisjunction is failure of paired homologus chromosomes to separate during the first meiotic division that leads to the production of gametes (ova and spermatozoa).
Thus, some gametes receive two and other receive none of the involved pair. After the second meiotic division the resulting gametes will have 24 and 22 chromosomes respectively. Such gametes are aneuploid.

Anaphase lag

In anaphase lag, one homologus chromosome in meiosis or one chromatid in mitosis lags behind and is left out of the cell nucleus. This results in one normal cell and one cell with monosomy.

Survival of Aneuploidy

Monosomy or trisomy involving the sex chromosome are compatible with life and are usually associated with variable degree of phenotypic abnormalities.
Monosomy involving an autosome generally represents loss of too much genetic information to permit live births or  even embryogenesis.
With the exception of trisomy 21 all others will produce severely handicapped infants who almost invariably die at an early age.

Biopsy was taken and histopathological examination showed endothelium-lined vascular spaces and the extreme proliferation of fibroblasts and budding endothelial cells. What could this lesion be: Pyogenic granuloma. Here is an additional explanation: Clinically, pyogenic granuloma is a raised lesion on either a sessile or a pedunculated base. Its surface may have a smooth, lobulated, or, occasionally, warty appearance that is erythematous and often ulcerated. Depending on the age of the lesion, the texture varies from soft to firm and is suggestive of an ulcerated fibroma. 
Because of the pronounced vascularity of these lesions, they often bleed easily when probed.
Histologically, the pyogenic granuloma presents as a remarkable proliferation of plump fibroblasts and endothelial cells with the formation of prominent numbers of  thin-walled, endothelium-lined vascular channels. A polymorphous inflammatory cell infiltrate is present, and the overlying surface epithelium is often ulcerated. Treatment consists of surgical excision, with care being taken to completely remove any local irritant that may still be present that would predispose to recurrence of the lesion.

Citrate - 3.2%Trisodium citrate - it is used for the determining the value of ESR and is also used for doing any kind of coagulation study. All the three (sodium EDTA, sodium fluoride, trisodium citrate) above use sodium. therefore, if we use any of these chemicals for the purpose of Serum Electrolyte measurement, the value of sodium and other electrolytes are going to be altered.
