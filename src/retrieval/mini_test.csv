History of stillbirth
History of neonatal death
History of fetal macrosomia
Concomitant obesity and/or hypertension
Development of oligohydramnios, polyhydramnios preeclampsia or fetal macrosomia
Inadequate metabolic control with diet alone.

âHigh risk gestational diabetic patients should have their labor induced when they reach 38 weeks with exception of those with a macrosomia fetus (Efw > 4000 g) who should be delivered by cesarean section because of the increased risk of shoulder dystociaâ.

Drug acting on cell wall of gram positive bacteria:March 2009,Vancomycin,opd,Gentamycin,Ciprofloxacin,Tetracycline,Vancomycin,"Drug acting on cell wall of gram positive bacteria:March 2009 Vancomycin. Here is an additional explanation: Ans. D: VancomycinVancomycins bind to the peptides of the peptidoglycan monomers and block both the formation of gycosidic bonds between the sugars by the transgycosidase enzymes and the formation of the peptide cross-links by the transpeptidase enzymes. This results in a weak cell wall and osmotic lysis of the bacterium.The fluoroquinolones (norfloxacin, lomefloxacin, fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, trovafloxacin, gatifloxacin, etc.) work by inhibiting one or more of a group of enzymes called topoisomerase, enzymes needed for supercoiling, replication and separation of circular bacterial DNA.For example, DNA gyrase is a topoisomerase that catalyzes the negative supercoiling of the circular DNA found in bacteria. Topoisomerase IV, on the other hand, is involved in the relaxation of the supercoiled circular DNA, enabling the separation of the interlinked daughter chromosomes at the end of bacterial DNA replication.In gram-positive bacteria, the main target for fluoroquinolones is DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II), an enzyme responsible for supercoiling of bacterial DNA during DNA replication; in gram-negative bacteria, the primary target is topoisomerase IV, an enzyme responsible for relaxation of supercoiled circular DNA and separation of the inter-linked daughter chromosomes.The tetracyclines (tetracycline, doxycycline, demeclocycline, minocycline, etc.) block bacterial translation by binding reversibly to the 30S subunit and distoing it in such a way that the anticodons of the charged tRNAs cannot align properly with the codons of the mRNA.The aminoglycosides (streptomycin, neomycin, netilmicin, tobramycin, gentamicin, amikacin, etc.) bind irreversibly to the 30S subunit of bacterial ribosomes.","For the given question, choose the correct answer from the options_list.

The angulation of the root to the crown, particularly of the single rooted anterior teeth isÂ  known as Collum angle. It is the angle formed by the intersection of the long axis of theÂ crown and root and it is measured using the lateral cephalogram.
Dental features of class II div 2 include a class II molar and canine relationship, deepÂ traumatic bite, retroclined upper four incisors or retroclined central incisors with a labialÂ inclination of the laterals and supra-erupted, upright lower incisors. The tooth size may beÂ  small, and upper incisors may have increased collum angle between the crown and the root.
The maxillary incisors in class II division 2 malocclusions are about 12Â° more vertical thanÂ those in normal occlusion.

Rinse with saline and reimplant. Here is an additional explanation: If a patient provided history that a tooth has been avulsed and it can be determined that the injury is without other oral. neurologic, or higher-priority physical complications. it is best to replace it in the socket immediately and to hold it in place with light finger pressure.
If the avulsion occurred in a clean environment, nothing should be done to the tooth before replants it. If the tooth is dirty, an attempt should be made to clean the root surface, but it is very important to preserve any remnants of the periodontal ligament that are still attached to the root. 'therefore the parent would then be instructed to keep the tooth immersed in a suitable storage medium and bring the child and the tooth for immediate care.
The patient should receive immediate attention after arriving at the dental office; and if it seems any contamination than it should be rinse thoroughly with saline only do not attempt to scrub tooth by any means to prevent vitality of periodontal fibers and re-implant it in socket.
If patient or parent cannot or will not replant it than procedure to maintain vitality of tooth
Allowing the avulsed tooth to dehydrate before replantation is damaging to a favourable prognosis.
Hanks buffered saline, isotonic saline, and pasteurized bovine milk may be the most favourable known storage media. If none of these solutions is readily available, human saliva is acceptable short-term substitute storage liquid. Presumably, the patient's saliva (and perhaps blood) would be readily available.
Although tap water has been a commonly recommended storage solution (and its use would be preferable to allowing dehydration of the tooth), saliva is a better storage medium. Neither water nor saliva is as good as milk or saline, if the tooth must be stored for a long period (more than 30 minutes before replantation). Because water is hypotonic, its use leads to rapid cell lysis and increased inflammation on replantation.","For the given question, choose the correct answer from the options_list.

Here is an additional explanation: Constriction of efferent aeriole has biphasic effect on GFR. At moderate levels of constriction, It increases glomerular hydrostatic pressure resulting in increasing GFR If efferent aeriolar constriction is severe; It decreases renal blood flow; filtration fraction & glomerular colloid osmotic pressure increases as efferent aeriolar resistance increases resulting in colloid osmotic pressure exceeds increase in glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure resulting in decrease in GFR. Blood from efferent aerioles enter peritubular capillaries, so if efferent aeriole is constricted, less blood enters peritubular capillaries, which results in increase in oncotic pressure in peri tubular capillaries.","For the given question, choose the correct answer from the options_list.

Bullet fingerprinting is:,Secondary marking,opc,Human fingerprints on bullet,Primary marking,Secondary marking,Distoed bullet,"Bullet fingerprinting is: Secondary marking. Here is an additional explanation: Bullet fingerprinting- Primary markings- The rifled firearm leaves its signature on the caridge case and on the bullet. With all rifled firearms, the bullet is slightly larger than the barrel, and as it passes through the barrel, its sides are marked by the rifling of the barrel. Secondary markings- They are produced on the surface of the bullet by imperfection on the inner surface of the barrel. These irregularities are produced by sticking of paicles of the bullet to the bore when shots are fired and is known as metallic fouling. They also result accidentally during the manufacturing process, usually microscopic in nature and have random distribution. They are useful in identifying the specific gun which was fired.","For the given question, choose the correct answer from the options_list.

Here is an additional explanation: Only 15% of bronchogenic cysts occur in lungs (pulmonary parenchyma).
Bronchogenic cysts 
Bronchogenic cyst is a congenital lung defect, which develops from abnormal lung budding of primitive foregut.
Most of the bronchogenic cyst arise in the mediastinum, where they are usually located in the mid mediastinumÂ  near carina. 
About 15% of Bronchogenic cyst also occurs in pulmonary parenchyma.
When located in the lung they are more common in right lung and lower lobe.
They are lined by cuboidal or ciliated columnar epithelial cells and are usually filled with mucoid material. Complications of Bronchogenic cyst :-
Infection of the cyst leading to lung abscess (illediastinal bronchogenic cysts do not communicate with the bronchi but those situated within the lung may communicate with the airways leading to abscess formation).
Compression can produce either hyperinflation of the lung or atelactasis due to obstruction.
Tension pneumothorax (d/t rupture of cyst that communicates with bronchus).","For the given question, choose the correct answer from the options_list.

Portion of tooth covered by calculus or altered cementum is:,Instrumentation zone,opc,Toxic zone,Deposit zone,Instrumentation zone,Take away zone,"Portion of tooth covered by calculus or altered cementum is: Instrumentation zone. Here is an additional explanation: Calculus is removed by a series of controlled, overlapping, short, powerful strokes primarily using wrist-arm motion . As calculus is removed, resistance toÂ  theÂ  passageÂ  ofÂ  theÂ  cuttingÂ  edgeÂ  diminishesÂ  untilÂ  onlyÂ  aÂ  slight roughnessÂ  remains.Â Longer,Â lighterÂ  root-planingÂ  strokesÂ  areÂ  then activated with less lateral pressure until the root surface is completely smooth and hard. The instrument handle must be rolled carefully between the thumb and fingers to keep the blade adapted closely to the tooth surface as line angles, developmental depressions, and other changes in tooth contour are followed. Scaling and root-planing strokes should be confined to the portion of the tooth where calculus or altered cementum is found; this area is known as the instrumentation zone. Sweeping the instrument over the crown where it is not needed wastes operating time, dulls the instrument, and causes lossÂ  of control.
Key Concept:
Scaling and root-planing strokes should be confined to the portion of the tooth where calculus or altered cementum is found; this area is known as the instrumentation zone. Sweeping the instrument over the crown where it is not needed wastes operating time, dulls the instrument, and causes lossÂ  of control.

It is an option to intervene at lower TSB levels for infatns closer to 35 weeks and at higher TSB levels for those closer to 37 6/7 wk. It is an option to provide conventional phototherapy in hospital or at home at TSB levels 2-3 mg/dL (35 - 50 mmol/L) below those shown but home phototherapy should not be used in any infant with risk factors. Cut off for phototherapy in 4-day old neonate is 19-20 mg/dl The dashed lines for the first 24 hours indicate unceainly due to a wide range of clinical circumstances and a range of responses to phototherapy.

The risk of down syndrome in the child is â 100%. Here is an additional explanation: Cvtogenetic aspects of own's syndrome -

The most common finding is trisomy 21.
Molecular studies have revealed that the additional number 21 chromosome is derived from the mother in 95% of Cases. (The recurrence risk in these families is approximately 1%.)
If a female with Down syndrome due to trisomy 21 conceives then there is a risk of 50% that the baby will also have trisomy 21.
Males with Down syndrome have rarely if ever reproduced.

Chromosome findings in Down syndrome

Trisomy 21, e.g. 47, XY, + 21Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  -Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  95%

Inheritence in Mosaic if own's syndrome

Children with mosaic Down syndrome are usually less severely affected than in the full-blown syndrome, and if only a small proportion of cells are trisomic then these individuals may lead normal lives.
In the event of reproduction, of these individuals there is a relatively high risk that the baby will have full trisomy 21 with the precise risk equalling the proportion of gametes which carry an additional number 21 chromosome.

Inheritance in Down's syndrome with tranclocation

When a child has Down syndrome as a result of an unbalanced Robertsonian translocation, there is a probability of around 25% that one of the parents will carry this in a balanced form. The remaining 75% of cases arise as de novo events and convey a low recurrence risk of approximately 1%
If, however, a parent is shown to be a carrier then there will be a significant risk that a future child will be affected, usually of the order of 2-5% for a carrier male and 10-15% for a carrier female.
In the very rare event that a parent carries a balanced 21q21e Robertsonian translocation, the risk of Down'sÂ Â  drome in liveborn offs rinâ¢ will be 100%.

Prions true is:,Readily inactivated by autoclave at 121oC,opa,Readily inactivated by autoclave at 121oC,Evokes strong immunogenic reaction,Have short incubation periods,Contains DNA/RNA,"Prions true is: Readily inactivated by autoclave at 121oC. Here is an additional explanation: Prions are infectious particles, which can transmit disease.
These prions are composed of chiefly a protein without any detectable nucleic acid.Â This is a new name widely accepted for the old name slow viruses. The term prion was coined by Prusiner for proteinaceous infectious particles.Â 
Unlike conventional viruses, the prions apparently have no virion structure or genomes and evoke no immune response in the infected host. These are extremely resistant to inactivation by heat, disinfectants, and radiation.
The prions are causative agents of slow viral infections, such as subacute spongiform encephalopathy. After long incubation period of years, they produce a progressive disease that causes damage to the central nervous system, leading to subacute spongiform encephalopathy.Â 
They are readily inactivated by autoclave at 121oC and resistant to antiseptics and disinfectants.

Slow waves 2. Spikes Slow waves: - Most gastro intestinal contractions occur rhythmically & this rhythm is determined mainly by frequency of 'slow waves' - These are not action potentials, instead they are slow undulating changes in resting membrane potential - These waves are caused by complex interactions among smooth muscle cells & interstitial cells of cajal. - Slow waves usually do not themselves cause muscle contraction (except in stomach) instead they mainly excite appearance of intermittent spike potential & spike potentials in turn actually excite muscle contraction. Parasympathetic neurons - depolarize smooth muscle cell & makes muscle fibers more excitable. Smooth muscle contraction occurs in response to entry of calcium ions into muscle fiber. Enteric nervous system composed of 2 plexuses 1. Myenteric plexus / Auerbach's plexus - outer 2.

Here is an additional explanation: When certain forms of blood stage parasites (gametocytes, which occur in male and female forms) are ingested during blood feeding by a female Anopheles mosquito, they mate in the gut of the mosquito and begin a cycle of growth and multiplication in the mosquito.Â 
After 10-18 days, a form of the parasite called a sporozoite migrates to the mosquitoâs salivary glands.Â 
When the Anopheles mosquito takes a blood meal on another human, anticoagulant saliva is injected together with the sporozoites, which migrate to the liver, thereby beginning a new cycle.

Hand wringing movements.
Impaired language and communication development.
Breath holding spells
Poor social skills
Decleration of hand growth after 6 months.


Now see the clinical features of Rett syndrome.

a. Age of onset is around 5 months.

Development may proceed normally until 1 yr of age, when regression of language and motor milestones become apparent.

a. Acquired microcephaly (Decleration of head growth due to significantly reduced brain weight).
* Most children develop peculiar sighing respirations with intermittent periods of apnea that may be associated with cyanosis --> Breath holding spells.

The hallmark of Rett syndrome is repetitive hand wringing movements and a loss ofpurposeful and spontaneous use of the hands.
Autistic behavior is a typical finding in all patients.
Generalized tonic-clonic convulsions occur in the majority.
Feeding disorder and poor weight gain are common.
Death occurs in adolescence or in the 3rd decade.
Cardiac arrhythmias may result in sudden, unexpected death.
Clinical features given in question prefectly match with Rett syndrome

Asperger syndrome

There were increased salivation and increased bronchial secretions. On examination, blood pressure was 88/60 mmHg. RBC esterase level is 50. What should be the treatment of this person? Atropine. Here is an additional explanation: Low esterase levels are suggestive of overdose of some drug which acts by inhibiting acetyl choline esterase like organophosphate poisoning. Inhibition of choline esterase results In increased amount of Ach at synapse, so poisoning or overdose results in cholinergic symptoms like salivation, lacrimation, urination, emesis, increased bronchial secretions, reduction in blood pressure.So treatment Of choice is Atropine. Atropine -It is highly effective in counter-acting the muscarinic symptoms, but higher doses are required to antagonize the central effects. It does not reverse peripheral muscular paralysis which is a nicotinic action. All cases of anti-ChE (carbamate or organophosphate) poisoning must be promptly given atropine2 mg i.v. repeated every 10 min till dryness of mouth or other signs of atropinization appear (upto 200 mg has been administered in a day). Continued treatment with maintenance doses may be required for 1-2 weeks. Neostigmine and physostigmine worsens the signs and symptoms as these also act by inhibiting choline esterase.

Doc of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy is,Metronidazole,opb,Clindamycin,Metronidazole,Erythromycin,Rovamycin,"Doc of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy is Metronidazole. Here is an additional explanation: - Metronidazole is drug of choice for bacterial vaginosis ( with or without pregnancy )- Alternative to metronidazole is clindamycin.- Rovamycin i.e. spiramycin (which is a macrolide) is drug of choice for toxoplasmosis in pregnancy. Metronidazole -* It is the prototype nitroimidazole having broad-spectrum cidal activity against anaerobic protozoa, including Giardia lamblia , trichomonas and amoeba. * Many anaerobic and microaerophilic bacteria, such as Bact. fragilis, Fusobacterium, Clostridium perfringens, Cl. difficile, Helicobacter pylori, Campylobacter, peptococci, spirochetes and anaerobic Streptococci are sensitive. * Metronidazole does not affect aerobic bacteria. Mechanism of action- After entering the cell by diffusion, its nitro group is reduced by ceain redox proteins operative only in anaerobic microbes to a highly reactive nitro radical which exes cytotoxicity. The nitro radical of metronidazole acts as an electron sink which competes with the biological electron acceptors of the anaerobic organism for the electrons generated by the pyruvate : ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) enzyme pathway of pyruvate oxidation. The energy metabolism of anaerobes that have no mitochondria is thus, disrupted. Aerobic environment attenuates cytotoxicity of metronidazole by inhibiting its reductive activation. Moreover, O2 competes with the nitro radical of metronidazole for the free electrons generated during energy metabolism of anaerobes. Metronidazole, in addition, has been found to inhibit cell mediated immunity, to induce mutagenesis and to cause radiosensitization.

Following renal disorder is associated with worst pregnancy outcome:,Scleroderma,opd,Systemic lupus erythromatosus,IgA nephropathy,Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease,Scleroderma,"Following renal disorder is associated with worst pregnancy outcome: Scleroderma. Here is an additional explanation: Prognostic indicators in renal disease and pregnancy:

Most reliable prognostic indicator of the outcome of pregnancy is the presence of hypertension. The fetal prognosis for women with chronic renal disease is favorable as long as they do not develop superimposed preeclampsia.
Second to hypertension, the most valuable prognostic index for patients with chronic renal disease during pregnancy is the degree of renal function impairment:

â In patients with normal or only midly impaired renal function, pregnancy does not accelerate renal damage
â In patients with moderate renal insufficiency (serum creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL or greater before pregnancy or creatinine clearance <30 ml/min. there is a decline in renal function during pregnancy).

Another important prognostic sign is the presence or absence of proteinuria. As a general rule, if the patient has 2+ or more protein in qualitative tests or 3 g or more in 24 hours urine collections at the beginning of pregnancy, the tendency will be toward increased protein losses and development of nephritic syndrome during pregnancy.
The histologic characteristics of the renal lesion also have prognostic value.","For the given question, choose the correct answer from the options_list.

the primary beam of radiation is to: Reduce radiation to the skin of the patient. Here is an additional explanation: Although an x-ray beam consists of a continuous spectrum of x-ray photon energies, only photons with sufficient energy to penetrate through anatomic structures and reach the image receptor (digital or film) are useful for diagnostic radiology. Low-energy photonsÂ that cannot reach the receptor contribute to patient risk but do no offer any benefit. Consequently, it is desirable to remove these low-energy photons from the beam. This removal can be accomplished in part by placing a metallic disk (filter) in the beam path.Â 
A filter preferentially removes low-energy photons from the beam, while allowing high energy photons that are able to contribute to making an image to pass through.Â

R. M. Ricketts suggested using an esthetic (E) plane to evaluate the relationship between the nose, lips and chin. Rickettsâ E line is drawn from the tip of the nose to the soft tissue chin. A quick method to look at one profile is to imagine a line tangent from the lower chin to the nose tip. Cephalometrically, Rickettsâ E line is drawn from the tip of the nose to the soft tissue chin. Normal values suggest that the upper lip is 4 mm behind the E line, while the lower lip lies 2 mm behind this reference line. It is important to mention that, this reference line is influenced a great deal by the growth of the nose and also varies with age and sex. Ricketts recommended that lip position should be analyzed using the noseâchin line as a reference point. These values are for Caucasians and clearly cannot be applied to all races.

Hardness of stone surface is affected by?,Hydrocolloid impression material,opc,Impression wax,Impression compound,Hydrocolloid impression material,Rubber based material,"Hardness of stone surface is affected by? Hydrocolloid impression material. Here is an additional explanation: ColloidalÂ systemsÂ suchÂ asÂ agarÂ andÂ alginateÂ retard the setting of gypsum products. If these materials areÂ in contact with CaSO4Â·Â½H2O during setting, a soft, easily abraded surface is obtained. Accelerators suchÂ as potassium sulfate are added to improve the surfaceÂ qualityÂ ofÂ theÂ setÂ CaSO4Â·2H2OÂ againstÂ agarÂ orÂ alginate.
These colloids do not retard the setting by altering theÂ solubility ratio of the hemihydrate and dihydrate forms, but rather by being adsorbed on the hemihydrate and dihydrate nucleation sites, thus interfering in the hydration reaction. The adsorption of these materials on the nucleating sites retards the setting reaction more effectively than adsorption on the calcium sulfate hemihydrate.

What is the likely diagnosis? Shin splint. Here is an additional explanation: Shin splints (stress fracture) are seen in runners, army recruits or any vigorous physical activity. STRESS/FATIGUE FRACTUREStress fracture is due to imbalance between load and resistance of bone. It is of 2 types:1. Fatigue Fracture: caused by application of abnormal stress on normal bone.2. Insufficiency Fracture: caused by normal activity on weak bone. Sites of Stress FracturesLower Extremity* March fracture is a stress fatigue fracture of second metatarsal neck > 3rd metatarsal neck.* The most common site is metatarsal neck followed by tibia (proximal third in children, middle third in athlete and lower third in elderly).* Tibia stress fracture = Shin splints* Femoral neck (inferomedial compression side in young and superior tension side in older patients).* Rarely fibula lower end (runners fracture). Upper Extremity* Olecranon is most common site of upper limb stress fractures. Pelvis and SpinePars inter aicularis of 5th lumbar veebral (causing spondylolysis) is commonest in spine. Clinical Presentation* Load related pain often bilateral* The hallmark physical finding is tenderness with palpation and stress. InvestigationMRI provide excellent sensitivity and superior specificity compared to bone scan in differentiating from infections or tumors.Bone scan is preferable for bilateral cases due to feasibility, also bilateral cases go in our of stress fracture as compared to Infection or tumor and also can scan the whole body.* Treatment is symptomatic with cast and cessation of activity.","For the given question, choose the correct answer from the options_list.

Here is an additional explanation: Midline intracranial mass with bruit on ausculation and features of hydrocephalus and congestive heart failure Â­All point towards Vein of Galen Malformation.

Vein of Galen Malformations(VGM) 

The vein of Galen is a large deep vein at the base of the brain. It is located under the cerebral hemispheres and drains the anterior and central regions of the brain into the sinuses of the posterior cerebral fossa .
VGM results from an aneurysmal malformation with an arteriovenous shunting of blood.VGM usually causes high-output heart failure in the newborn resulting from the decreased resistance and high blood flow in the lesion.
Associated findings include cerebral ischemic changes such as strokes or steal phenomena that result in progressive hemiparesis.
The malformation may result in mass effects, causing progressive neurological impairment. Alternatively, the malformation may cause obstruction of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow and result in hydrocephalus.
Loud intracranial bruit may be heard because of the blood turbulence in VGM.
The most effective treatment for the malformation has been embolization rather than surgery 
The vein of Galen abnormality is the most frequent arteriovenous malformation in neonates.","For the given question, choose the correct answer from the options_list.

Which one of the following drugs you would like to avoid â Isoprenaline. Here is an additional explanation: In Tetralogy of Fallot there is right outflow obstruction due to pulmonary stenosis with supravalvular pulmonary artery obstruction.


In case of severe obstruction, the right ventricular pressure becomes greater than the left ventricular presence and the deoxygenated blood starts moving to the left ventricle resulting in severe cyanosis and erythrocytosis.
In this situation the aim is to increase blood flow towards the right heart. The methods adopted are compression of Aorta (knee chest position) and use of vasopressor drugs like methoxamine (Phenylepinephrine is also a vasopressor).
Any condition or drug which causes peripheral pooling of blood should be avoided because this will reduce return of blood to heart.
Therefore isoprenaline which has marked 13, agonistic action should be avoided as it will cause vasodilatation which leads to peripheral pooling of blood. This will be harmful in a case of Tetralogy of Fallot.","For the given question, choose the correct answer from the options_list.

Here is an additional explanation: Diagnosis of urinary tract infection

A UTI may be suspected based on the symptoms or finding on urinalysis or both, but a urine culture is necessary for confirmation and appropriate therapy.
Thus the diagnosis of UTI depends on having the proper sample of urine.
There are several ways to obtain a urine sample, some are more accurate than others.
These methods are â


Midstream urine sample â

It is satisfactory in toilet trained children and in circumcised boys. But in young infants and boys who cannot ratract their foreskin, it is not reliable. Such samples will usually reflect periurethral and prepucial organisms and cells.

Collection in an adhesive sealed sterile collection bag after disinfection of the genitals


Is a useful technique in infants, but potential contamination from genitals and perianal area can occur.

3. Urine specimen through catheterization or indwelling catheter â

Urine specimen through a catheter is less likely to be contaminated than the voided specimens as described above. It is also less invasive than suprapubic aspiration, but it is not as sensitive as suprapubic aspiration.


A catherized specimen is reliable if the first portion of the urine that may contain urethral organisms is discarded and specimen is taken from later flow through the catheter, but it has the disadvantage of being traumatic and of potentially introducing urethral organisms into sterile bladder


Suprapubic aspiration -
Suprapubic aspiration is best method to collect urine specimen for culture.
It is the most reliable method
It can be performed safely in children and in premature infants by 21 or 22 gauge needle.
This procedure avoids any sort of contamination, however it is invasive. So it is used only in infants and selected patients.
Note:

The sensitivity of suprapubic aspiration is 99 %

The most specific investigation is Histopathological examination. Here is an additional explanation: The answer is A Acute pyelonephritis is a bacterial infection causing inflammation of the kidneys and is one of the most common diseases of the kidney.Pyelonephritis occurs as a complication of an ascending urinary tract infection (UTI) which spreads from the bladder to the kidneys and their collecting systems.Symptoms usually include fever, flank pain, nausea, vomiting, burning on urination, increased frequency, and urgency. The 2 most common symptoms are usually fever and flank pain. E. coli is the most common bacteria causing acute pyelonephritis due to its unique ability to adhere to and colonize the urinary tract and kidneys.Histopathology will usually reveal necrosis or putrid abscess formation within the renal parenchyma. The renal tissues are infiltrated with neutrophils, macrophages and plasma cells. However, architecture is not completely disorganized.The presence of white blood cells within or upon casts strongly suggests pyelonephritis, direct infection of the kidney. They may also be seen in inflammatory states, such as acute allergic interstitial nephritis, nephrotic syndrome, or post-streptococcal acute glomerulonephritis.","For the given question, choose the correct answer from the options_list.

Sweat chloride test was done, showed values of 36 and 42. What is the next best investigation to confirm the diagnosis ? Transepithelial nasal potential difference. Here is an additional explanation: Diagnosis of cystic fibrosis 
1.Â Â  Sweat chloride testing

The sweat test is the standard approach to diagnosis.
The diagnosis is made by elevated sodium and chloride level in the sweat > 60 meq/1.
Two test on different days are required for accurate diagnosis.
A normal sweat chloride dose not exclude the diagnosis. Genotyping and other tests such as measurement of nasal membrane potential difference, pancreatic function should be done if there is high clinical suspicion of cystic fibrosis.

2.Â Â  Nasal potential difference

Measurement of nasal transepithelial potential difference in vivo can be useful adjunct in the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.
Individuals with cystic fibrosis demonstrate a significantly more negative baseline nasal potential difference, with the topical application of amiloride there is loss of this potential difference.

3.Â Â  Genetic analysis

Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder.
It is caused due to defect in CFTR (Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) protein.
Cystic fibrosis is associated with large number of mutations.
More than 1500 CFTR polymorphisms are associated with cystic fibrosis syndrome.
The most prevalent mutation of CFTR is the deletion of single phenylalanine residue at amino acid A508.
This mutation is responsible for high incidence of cystic fibrosis in northern European populations.
Approximately 50% of individuals with CF who are of northern European ancestry are homozygous for A508 and >70% carry at least one A508 gene. The remainder of patients has an extensive array of mutation, none of which has prevalance of more than several percent.
Testing for cystic fibrosis mutation was not possible because of the large no. of mutations associated with the disease.
Now days commercial laboratories test for 30-80 of the most common CFTR mutations.
This testing identifies >90% individuals who carry 2CF mutations.
No where it is mentioned in the texts that testing only for A508 is enough for diagnosis. Detection of atleast 2 CF mutations are necessary for making the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.","For the given question, choose the correct answer from the options_list.

Which of the following diseases is diagnosed with the help of the flowcytometry pattern?,Hyper IgM syndrome,opc,Bruton disease,Bare lymphocyte syndrome,Hyper IgM syndrome,Severe combined immunodeficiency disease,"Which of the following diseases is diagnosed with the help of the flowcytometry pattern? Hyper IgM syndrome. Here is an additional explanation: Flow cytometry can rapidly and quantitatively measure several individual cell characteristics, but is mainly used to identify cellular antigens expressed by liquidtumors , those that arise from blood forming tissues. Hyper IgM syndrome - In this disorder the affected patients make IgM antibodies but are deficient in their ability to produce IgG, IgA and IgE antibodies. There is problem in Ig class switching. Approximately 70%of individuals with hyper lgM syndrome have the X linked form of the disease , caused by mutations in the gene coding CD40L located on Xq26. In remaining patients,the disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Most of these patients have loss of function mutation involving either CD40 or enzyme called AID. So, B-cells can be detected by flowcytometryhaving low expression of CD40. Bruton's disease -In this disease, there is defect in B-cell tyrosine kinase enzyme. This leads to hypogammaglobulinemia. Bare lymphocyte syndrome- In this disorder, There is defect in MHC-2 molecule which is required for CD4 T-cell formation.

Dideoxyribonucleotides. Here is an additional explanation: PCR is an in vitro DNA amplification procedure in which millions of copies of a paicular sequence of DNA can be produced within a few hours.The reaction cycle has the following steps:Step 1: Separation (Denaturation): DNA strands are separated (melted) by heating at 95degC for 15 seconds to 2 minutes.Step 2: Priming (Annealing): The primers are annealed by cooling to 50degC for 0.5 to 2 minutes. The primers hybridize with their complementary single-stranded DNA produced in the first step.Step 3: Polymerization: New DNA strands are synthesized by Taq polymerase. This enzyme is derived from bacteria Thermus aquaticus that are found in hot springs.The steps of 1,2 and 3 are repeated. In each cycle, the DNA strands are doubled. Thus, 20 cycles provide for 1 million times amplifications. These cycles are generally repeated by automated instrument, called Tempcycler.5.

Which of the following drug should be used for the treatment? Pyridoxine. Here is an additional explanation: Patient is developing tingling sensation (peripheral neuropathy) which is a side effect of Isoniazid (INH) a first line antitubercular drug. INH is extensively metabolized in liver; most impoant pathway being N-acetylation by NAT2. The acetylated metabolite is excreted in urine. The rate of INH acetylation shows genetic variation. There are either: Fast acetylators: (30-40% of Indians) t1/2 of INH 1 hr. Slow acetylators: (60-70% of Indians) t1/2 of INH 3 hr. Slow acetylators will not be able to metabolize the drug quickly and there will be accumulation of isoniazid. Isoniazid inhibits pyridoxal phosphokinase enzyme and hence causes peripheral neuritis, paraesthesias, numbness etc. Pyridoxine given prophylactically (10mg/day) prevents this neurotoxicity. On the other hand, fast acetylators are more prone to develop.","For the given question, choose the correct answer from the options_list.

She delivers by normal vaginal route which of the following statement is true? Baby will develop neoatal varicella syndrome. Here is an additional explanation: Varicella infection in pregnancy:

If varicella infection occurs in a pregnant female during first half of pregnancy (M/C time of transmission-13 to 20 weeks) it results in congenital varicella syndrome in the fetus.
Congenital varicella syndrome in characterized by chorioretinitis, microophthalmia, cerebral cortical atrophy, IUGR, hydronephrosis and skin or bone defects.
Congenital varicella syndrome is an indication for doing MTP.
Congenital defects rarely occurs if varicella infection occurs after 20 weeks.
The terminology varicella embryopathy is not used these days.
Neonatal varicella iin characterized by pneumonitis, hepatitis and DIC.
The severity of neonatal infection is inversely related to the concentration of maternal antibodies present in the newborn circulation. Mother starts producing and transferring antibodies approximately 5 days after the onset of her disease.Thus, babies born 5 days or more from the beginning of maternal disease will be protected.

Fernando Arias 3/e, p 156

Perinatal varicella exposure just before or during delivery poses a serious threat to newborns and so Varicella Ig should be given to all neonates of born to mothers who have clinical evidence of varicella 5 days before and upto 2 days after delivery.
The use of VZIG decreases the chances of neonatal varicella and also modify the clinical course but it does not always prevent severe or fatal varicella. Expectant treatment with close observation, followed by prompt initiation of antiviral therapy on suspicion of neonatal varicella is recommended.
Antiviral treatment (acyclovir) is given to neonates only if they develop neonatal varicella syndrome.

A mother is Hbs Ag positive and anti Hbe Ag positive. Risk of transmission of Hep. B in child is:,20%,opa,20%,50%,0%,90%,"A mother is Hbs Ag positive and anti Hbe Ag positive. Risk of transmission of Hep. B in child is: 20%. Here is an additional explanation: Before answering these questions lets first discuss hepatitis in brief.
Maternal infection: The acute infection is manifested by flu like illness as malaise, anorexia, nausea and vomiting. In majority, it remains asymptomatic. Jaundice is rare and fever is uncommon.
Clinical course (HBV): Nearly 90â95% of patients clear the infection and have full recovery. 1% develop fulminant hepatitis resulting massive hepatic necrosis. 10-15% become chronic and 10% of these chronic cases suffer from chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
Diagnosis is confirmed by serological detection of HBsAg, HBeAg (denote high infectivity) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) and HBV DNA titer (107â1011).
Screening: All pregnant women should be screened for HBV infection at first antenatal visit and it should be repeated during the third trimester for âhigh riskâ groups (intravenous drug abusers, sexual promiscuity, hemophilics, patients on hemodialysis or having multiple sex partners).
Hepatitis C (HCV):
It is recognized as the major cause of non-A, non-B hepatitis worldwide and is the leading cause of transfusion associated hepatitis. Transmission is mainly blood borne and to a lesser extent by faecal-oral route. It is responsible for chronic active hepatitis and hepatic failure.
Perinatal transmission (10â40%) is high when coinfected with HIV and HBV.
Detection is by antibody to HCV by EIA, which develops usually late in the infection.
Confirmation is done by recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA-3).
Chronic carrier state is present. Breastfeeding is not contraindicated.
Hepatitis D (HDV):
It is seen in patients infected with HBV either as a co-infection or super infection. Perinatal transmission is known.
Hepatitis E (HEV): Hepatitis E is the most important cause of non-A, non-B hepatitis in developing countries like India. Chronic carrier state is present. Perinatal transmission is uncommon.

"A pregnant lady with persistent late, variable deceleration with cervical dilatation of 6 cm shifted to OT for surgery. Which of the following is not done in Mmn:",Supine position,opa,Supine position,O2 inhalation,I.V. fluid,Subcutaneous terbutaline,"A pregnant lady with persistent late, variable deceleration with cervical dilatation of 6 cm shifted to OT for surgery. Which of the following is not done in Mmn: Supine position. Here is an additional explanation: âDeceleration is defined as a decrease in fetal heart rate below the base line of 15 beats per minute or more.â
Variable deceleration is seen in case of cord-compression/prolapse. In case of cord-compression/prolapse patient should not be allowed to rest in supine position as it will lead to more pressure on the cord. In cord prolapse the patient is allowed to rest in exaggerated elevated Sims position with a pillow under the hip.
Management of Non-reassuring fetal status (Fetal Distress)

Lateral positioning avoids compression of vena cava and aorta by the gravid uterus. This increases cardiac output and uteroplacental perfusion.
Oxygen is administered to the mother with mask to improve fetal SaO2.
Correction of dehydration by IV fluids (crystalloids) improves intravascular volume and uterine perfusion.
Correction of maternal hypotension (following epidural analgesia) with immediate infusion of 1 litre of Crystalloid (Ringerâs solution).
Stoppage of oxytocin to improve fetal oxygenation. Fetal hypoxia may be due to strong and sustained uterine contractions. With reassuring FHR and in absence of fetal acidemia, oxytocin may be restarted.
Tocolytic (Injection terbutaline 0.25 mg S.C.) is given when uterus is hypertonic and there is nonreassuring FHR.
Amnioinfusion is the process to increase the intrauterine fluid volume with warm normal saline (500 ml). Indications are:

â Oligohydramnios and cord compression
â To dilute or to wash out meconium
â To improve variable or prolonged decelerations.

Regarding ASO titre all are seen except â,ASO titre included in major criteria in jones criteria,opc,ASO can be increased in school children,May be negative in post streptococcal glomerulonephritis,ASO titre included in major criteria in jones criteria,May not be elevated in 20% cases of carditis,"Regarding ASO titre all are seen except â ASO titre included in major criteria in jones criteria. Here is an additional explanation: Evidence of antecedent group 'A' streptococcal infection 

Positive throat cultures or rapid streptococcal antigen tests for group A streptococcoci are less reliable for antecedent infection capable of producing rheumatic fever because they do not distinguish between recent infection and chronic pharyngeal carriage (as many people are carrier of this bacteria).
Antibody tests are the most reliable laboratory evidence of antecedent streptococcal infection capable of producingÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â  g acute rheumatic fever. The onset of clinical manifestations of acute rheumatic fever coincides with the peak of the streptococcal antibody response.
The antibodies used commonly for serological tests are antistreptolysin 0 (ASO), antideoxyribonuclease (Anti-DNAse) and antihyaluronidase.
ASO titre is well standardized and therefore is most widely used test. It has following features.


Elevated in 80% of patients with acute rheumatic fever (So, 20% patients do not show elevated titre) Sensitivity is 80%.
It is elevated in 20% of normal individuals perticularly in healthy school children of elementary school age (20% false positive).
ASO titers of at least 333 Todd units in children and 250 Todd units in adults are considered elevated.
It is included in minor criteria of jones criteria (not in major criteria).


Anti DNAse B titers of 240 Todd units or greater in children and 1200 Todd units or greater in adults are considered elevated.
If three antibody tests (ASO, anti-DNAse and anti-hyaluronidase) are used simultaneously, a titer for at least one antibody test is elevated in 95% of cases â> Sensitivity of combined three antibody tests is 95%.
The streptozyme test is a simple slide agglutination test for extra-cellular streptococcal antigen absorbed to red blood cells (passive hemagglutination) test. It is almost 100% sensitive but specificity is very low and it is less standardized and less reproducible than the other antibody tests. Therefore, it should not be used as a diagnostic test for evidence of antecedent group A streptococcal infection.

Most common cause of post term pregnancy is wrong dates so, a careful review of menstrual history is important in all
such cases â
âIf the patient is sure about her date with previous history of regular cycles, it is a fairly reliable diagnostic aid in the calculation of the period of gestation. But in cases of mistaken maturity or pregnancy occurring during lactational amenorrhoea or soon following withdrawal of the pillâ, confusion arises. In such cases, the previous well documented antenatal records of first visit in first trimester if available, are useful guides.â
