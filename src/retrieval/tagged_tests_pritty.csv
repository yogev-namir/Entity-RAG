",The first line of therapy in anaphylactic shock is Epinephrine 0.5 ml of 1:1000 administered through the intramuscular route.,"Answer: option_c: Epinephrine .5 ml of 1:1000 IM

Explanation: According to the provided contexts, atropine is not recommended as first-line therapy in anaphylactic shock. Atropine is used for certain types of nerve agent and pesticide poisonings, as well as for slowing heart rate and reducing saliva production. However, it is not recommended for routine use in the management of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) or asystole, as per the AHA 2020 guidelines. Therefore, option B can be eliminated. 

Additionally, the contexts mention that epinephrine is used in cardiac arrest and is administered at a specific dose and interval. While the exact dose mentioned in option D (1 ml of 1:10000) is not specified, the context does state that the dose and interval for epinephrine remain unchanged in the ACLS guidelines. This suggests that option D may be a viable treatment option, but it is not explicitly stated to be the first-line therapy for anaphylactic shock. 

Therefore, based on the information provided, the correct answer is option C: Epinephrine .5 ml of 1:1000 IM. This aligns with the context stating that epinephrine is used in cardiac arrest and that the dose and interval for its administration remain unchanged.",Correct,Correct

236,"question: Lacrimation is affected due to damage to which of the following nerves?

option_a:Nasociliary nerve
option_b:Greater petrosal nerve
option_c:Trigeminal nerve
option_d:Anterior ethmoid nerve
","The correct answer is option_a: Nasociliary nerve.

The nasociliary nerve is a branch of the ophthalmic nerve (one of the three divisions of the trigeminal nerve), and it supplies the lacrimal gland, which produces tears. Damage to the nasociliary nerve can affect lacrimation (tear production and secretion).","**Option A: Nasociliary nerve**

The nasociliary nerve is a branch of the ophthalmic nerve, which is one of the three divisions of the trigeminal nerve (CN V). The trigeminal nerve is indeed mentioned in the context, but not in relation to lacrimation. However, it is important to understand the structure and functions of the trigeminal nerve to identify its role in lacrimation.

Now, let's understand why the correct answer is the nasociliary nerve:

The trigeminal nerve (CN V) has three main branches: the ophthalmic nerve, the maxillary nerve, and the mandibular nerve. The ophthalmic nerve has several branches, including the nasociliary nerve, which provides sensory innervation to the nasal cavity, ethmoid air sinuses, and the skin of the lower half of the nose and upper lip. Importantly, the nasociliary nerve also carries postganglionic parasympathetic fibers that are derived from the facial nerve (CN VII) via the ciliary ganglion. These parasympathetic fibers are responsible for lacrimation, or tear production, by stimulating the lacrimal gland.

So, if there is damage to the nasociliary nerve, lacrimation would be affected because the nerve no longer carries the parasympathetic signals to the lacrimal gland for tear production.

While the other options are all related to the nervous system, they are not directly involved in lacrimation:
- Greater petrosal nerve (option B): This nerve is involved in supplying parasympathetic innervation to the lacrimal nerve, which then carries these fibers to the lacrimal gland for tear production. However, the question specifically asks about direct damage to a nerve affecting lacrimation, and the nasociliary nerve is the direct link in this case.
- Trigeminal nerve (option C): While the trigeminal nerve is important for sensory and motor functions in the head and face, it is not directly responsible for lacrimation. The trigeminal nerve itself does not carry parasympathetic fibers for tear production.
- Anterior ethmoid nerve (option D): This nerve is a branch of the nasal branch of the ophthalmic nerve. It provides sensory innervation to the ethmoid air sinuses and the nasal mucosa. It is not directly involved in lacrimation.",Incorrect,Incorrect
127,"question: Initial clicking of TMJ while opening is due to

option_a:Protruded condyle in respect to articular disc
option_b:Retruded condyle in respect to articular disc
option_c:Perforated disc
option_d:Lateral displacement of the condyle
",The initial clicking of TMJ while opening is due to a protruded condyle in respect to the articular disc.,"**Option A: Protruded condyle in respect to articular disc** is the correct answer. 

The initial clicking sound in TMJ (Temporomandibular Joint) disorders is often associated with the displacement of the articular disc, which is a result of a protruded condyle. This occurs when the condyle moves forward and the articular disc is unable to maintain its normal position, leading to a temporary displacement and the characteristic clicking sound. 

The provided context mentions the role of the lateral pterygoid muscle in controlling the position and movement of the articular disc. A medial dislocation of a fractured condyle can also be caused by this muscle, further highlighting its importance in TMJ function. 

While the other options may be related to TMJ disorders or dysfunction, they do not directly explain the initial clicking sound.",Incorrect,Incorrect
376,"question: Which of the following Slatements is not true?

option_a:Parathyroid hormone-related protein is responsible for causing hypercalcemia in cancer patients
option_b:The unionized fraction of calcium in the plasma is an impoant determinant of PTH secretion
option_c:Mg2+ influences PTH secretion in the same direction as Ca2+ but is a less potent secretagogue
option_d:Ca2+influences PTH secretion by acting on a calcium sensor G-protein coupled receptor located in the parathyroid gland
",The answer is option_a: Parathyroid hormone-related protein is responsible for causing hypercalcemia in cancer patients.,"Answer: option_a
Explanation: The context mentions that hyperparathyroidism can lead to increased calcium levels, and parathyroid adenomas are a common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism. However, there is no mention of cancer patients experiencing hypercalcemia due to parathyroid hormone-related protein. Therefore, option A is the only statement that is not supported by the provided information.",Incorrect,Incorrect

option_d:Overstimulation of respiratory centre
",vomiting,"Answer: option_c: Increase vomiting

Explanation: The patient in question has a biliary duct stricture and is experiencing retching and vomiting. They are administered morphine, and due to an error, they receive a higher dose than intended. Morphine is known to have side effects, particularly when it comes to the gastrointestinal system, and one of its common side effects is nausea and vomiting. Given the patient's existing condition and the fact that they are already experiencing vomiting, an increased dose of morphine could exacerbate these symptoms and lead to increased vomiting.",Incorrect,Incorrect
321,"question: In Galactorrhoea--amenorrhea syndromes, which is the investigation you should advise (apa from serum prolactin)?

option_a:TSH
option_b:LH
option_c:hCG
option_d:Urinary ketosteroids
",LH.,"Answer: option_b:LH

Explanation: In a case of galactorrhoea and amenorrhea, it is important to investigate beyond serum prolactin levels. The presence of galactorrhoea suggests hyperprolactinemia, which can be caused by various factors, including medications, stress, or a prolactin-secreting tumor. However, the patient's history of radius and ulnar forearm fractures, peripheral vision issues, and headaches points towards a possible pituitary tumor, which could be causing both the galactorrhea and amenorrhea.

Among the options provided, LH (luteinizing hormone) is the most appropriate investigation to advise in this case. LH is a hormone that plays a crucial role in reproductive function. In women, LH stimulates the production of estrogen and progesterone, which are essential for ovulation and menstruation. By measuring LH levels, we can gain insights into the patient's ovarian function and possible causes of amenorrhea.

While TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) and hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) levels can provide valuable information about thyroid function and pregnancy status, respectively, they are not as specific to the patient's presentation of galactorrhoea and amenorrhea. Urinary ketosteroids can help evaluate adrenal function but are less relevant to the patient's current concerns. Therefore, LH is the most suitable investigation to advise, in addition to serum prolactin, to further evaluate the patient's condition and determine the underlying cause of her symptoms.",Incorrect,Incorrect

option_b:Metabolic acidosis
option_c:Metabolic alkalosis
option_d:Respiratory alkalosis
",Respiratory acidosis.,"Answer: option_a
Explanation: The provided contexts indicate that elevated pCO2 levels are associated with respiratory acidosis. In the given question, the patient's pCO2 level is 35 mm Hg, which is higher than the typical range of 35-45 mm Hg. This elevated pCO2 level suggests a respiratory issue, leading to the diagnosis of respiratory acidosis.",Incorrect,Incorrect
617,"question: The proximal walls of a class II cavity on a deciduous molar:

option_a:Follow directions of enamel rods
option_b:Converge toward occlusal surface
option_c:Diverge toward occlusal surface
option_d:Undermine enamel which is very thin
",The answer is option_a: Follow directions of enamel rods.,"Answer: option_a
Explanation: The context mentions that the ""Mesial and distal wall of a class V cavity depends on the direction of enamel rods."" While this information does not directly refer to a class II cavity on a deciduous molar, it provides a general principle that the direction of enamel rods influences the preparation of cavity walls. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the same principle applies to the proximal walls of a class II cavity.",Incorrect,Incorrect
107,"question: Chances of ankyloses of mandibular molar which is autotransplanted depends on?

option_a:Splinting of mandibular molar
option_b:Surgical extraction of molar
option_c:Socket preparation of molar for autotransplantation
option_d:Root kept moist in cotton
","The chances of ankylosis of a mandibular molar that is autotransplanted depend on several factors, including the age of the patient, the stage of root development, the presence or absence of a luxation membrane, and the quality of the surgical technique.

Among the options provided, the correct answer is:
**option_a: Splinting of mandibular molar**

Proper splinting of the autotransplanted mandibular molar is crucial to prevent tooth movement and micro-trauma, which can lead to ankylosis. The splint helps stabilize the tooth and reduce the risk of ankylosis by allowing the periodontal ligament to heal properly.

While the other options (surgical extraction, socket preparation, and keeping the root moist) are important considerations in the autotransplantation process, they do not directly impact the chances of ankylosis to the same degree as proper splinting.","Answer: option_a: Splinting of mandibular molar

Explanation: While the provided information does not directly answer the question, it can be inferred that splinting of the mandibular molar is a critical step in the reimplantation process. This is supported by the context, which emphasizes the importance of stabilizing the tooth after reimplantation using a flexible splint. The splint helps to keep the tooth in place and stabilize it, which likely influences the chances of ankylosis.",Incorrect,Incorrect
782,"question: A mother comes with her 3 months' child asking the physician if she can give cereals to her child. What problems can this lead to her child?

option_a:Allergy due to the food content
option_b:Risk of gastrointestinal infection
option_c:Retarded oro-motor development
option_d:Contaminated food leading to reflux
",Retarded oro-motor development.,"Answer: option_c
Explanation: The child is only 3 months old, and introducing cereals at this age can lead to oro-motor development issues. The child's digestive system may not be ready to handle solid foods yet, which can cause problems with chewing and swallowing. It is recommended to exclusively breastfeed infants for the first 6 months of life, as per the WHO guidelines.",Incorrect,Incorrect
