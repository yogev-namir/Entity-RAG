","question: First line therapy in anaphylactic shock is:

option_a:Adenosine 12 mg intravenously
option_b:Atropine 3 mg intravenously
option_c:Epinephrine .5 ml of 1:1000 IM
option_d:Epinephrine 1 ml of 1:10000 intravenously
",The first line of therapy in anaphylactic shock is Epinephrine 0.5 ml of 1:1000 administered through the intramuscular route.,"Answer: option_c: Epinephrine .5 ml of 1:1000 IM

Explanation: According to the provided contexts, atropine is not recommended as first-line therapy in anaphylactic shock. Atropine is used for certain types of nerve agent and pesticide poisonings, as well as for slowing heart rate and reducing saliva production. However, it is not recommended for routine use in the management of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) or asystole, as per the AHA 2020 guidelines. Therefore, option B can be eliminated. 

Additionally, the contexts mention that epinephrine is used in cardiac arrest and is administered at a specific dose and interval. While the exact dose mentioned in option D (1 ml of 1:10000) is not specified, the context does state that the dose and interval for epinephrine remain unchanged in the ACLS guidelines. This suggests that option D may be a viable treatment option, but it is not explicitly stated to be the first-line therapy for anaphylactic shock. 

Therefore, based on the information provided, the correct answer is option C: Epinephrine .5 ml of 1:1000 IM. This aligns with the context stating that epinephrine is used in cardiac arrest and that the dose and interval for its administration remain unchanged.",Correct,Correct

Pruritis due to morphine is not due to histamine release, high dose morphine can spread centrally, act on trigeminal nerve and cause pruritis.

",vomiting,"Answer: option_c: Increase vomiting

Explanation: The patient in question has a biliary duct stricture and is experiencing retching and vomiting. They are administered morphine, and due to an error, they receive a higher dose than intended. Morphine is known to have side effects, particularly when it comes to the gastrointestinal system, and one of its common side effects is nausea and vomiting. Given the patient's existing condition and the fact that they are already experiencing vomiting, an increased dose of morphine could exacerbate these symptoms and lead to increased vomiting.",Incorrect,Incorrect
