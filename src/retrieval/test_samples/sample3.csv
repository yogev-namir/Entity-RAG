","question: In Galactorrhoea--amenorrhea syndromes, which is the investigation you should advise (apa from serum prolactin)?

option_a:TSH
option_b:LH
option_c:hCG
option_d:Urinary ketosteroids
",LH.,"Answer: option_b:LH

Explanation: In a case of galactorrhoea and amenorrhea, it is important to investigate beyond serum prolactin levels. The presence of galactorrhoea suggests hyperprolactinemia, which can be caused by various factors, including medications, stress, or a prolactin-secreting tumor. However, the patient's history of radius and ulnar forearm fractures, peripheral vision issues, and headaches points towards a possible pituitary tumor, which could be causing both the galactorrhea and amenorrhea.

Among the options provided, LH (luteinizing hormone) is the most appropriate investigation to advise in this case. LH is a hormone that plays a crucial role in reproductive function. In women, LH stimulates the production of estrogen and progesterone, which are essential for ovulation and menstruation. By measuring LH levels, we can gain insights into the patient's ovarian function and possible causes of amenorrhea.

While TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) and hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) levels can provide valuable information about thyroid function and pregnancy status, respectively, they are not as specific to the patient's presentation of galactorrhoea and amenorrhea. Urinary ketosteroids can help evaluate adrenal function but are less relevant to the patient's current concerns. Therefore, LH is the most suitable investigation to advise, in addition to serum prolactin, to further evaluate the patient's condition and determine the underlying cause of her symptoms.",Incorrect,Incorrect
