the primary beam of radiation is to: Reduce radiation to the skin of the patient. Here is an additional explanation: Although an x-ray beam consists of a continuous spectrum of x-ray photon energies, only photons with sufficient energy to penetrate through anatomic structures and reach the image receptor (digital or film) are useful for diagnostic radiology. Low-energy photons that cannot reach the receptor contribute to patient risk but do no offer any benefit. Consequently, it is desirable to remove these low-energy photons from the beam. This removal can be accomplished in part by placing a metallic disk (filter) in the beam path. 
A filter preferentially removes low-energy photons from the beam, while allowing high energy photons that are able to contribute to making an image to pass through.

","question: Chances of ankyloses of mandibular molar which is autotransplanted depends on?

option_a:Splinting of mandibular molar
option_b:Surgical extraction of molar
option_c:Socket preparation of molar for autotransplantation
option_d:Root kept moist in cotton
","The chances of ankylosis of a mandibular molar that is autotransplanted depend on several factors, including the age of the patient, the stage of root development, the presence or absence of a luxation membrane, and the quality of the surgical technique.

Among the options provided, the correct answer is:
**option_a: Splinting of mandibular molar**

Proper splinting of the autotransplanted mandibular molar is crucial to prevent tooth movement and micro-trauma, which can lead to ankylosis. The splint helps stabilize the tooth and reduce the risk of ankylosis by allowing the periodontal ligament to heal properly.

While the other options (surgical extraction, socket preparation, and keeping the root moist) are important considerations in the autotransplantation process, they do not directly impact the chances of ankylosis to the same degree as proper splinting.","Answer: option_a: Splinting of mandibular molar

Explanation: While the provided information does not directly answer the question, it can be inferred that splinting of the mandibular molar is a critical step in the reimplantation process. This is supported by the context, which emphasizes the importance of stabilizing the tooth after reimplantation using a flexible splint. The splint helps to keep the tooth in place and stabilize it, which likely influences the chances of ankylosis.","Answer: option_a: Splinting of mandibular molar
